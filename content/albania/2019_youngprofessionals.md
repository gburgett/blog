# The in-between

I had a full week in between the [Shkoder project](/albania/2019_shkodra) and the YP
project.  I spent half of it working remote and the rest just catching up with
friends.  I found a really good coffee shop to work from. with a wonderful view.

# Day 1
<h2 id="July-7" class="hidden-xs">Sunday July 7</h2>

Today my first responsibility was going to get everyone from the airport.  Back
on the receiving end!  I enjoy hosting and it was fun to be able to welcome
everyone and get them settled in.  First thing we did was go to the hotel, where
Joanne went straight in to take a nap.  Smart choice.  The rest of us got up and
went out for lunch. We had Suflaqe across the street, and near the end of lunch a couple people who
thought they were OK ended up just being done.  So they headed back to the hotel
while the rest of us walked around and exchanged leke, bought water, and took care
of whatever needs we could think of.

At about 5pm we all woke up in order to get a walk in before dinner.  Even though
it was hot it was good for us to get up and moving.  It's really the best
medicine against jetlag.  We walked up to the Qender, got ice cream at Mango,
and then had a coffee at Taiwan center.  I shared a bit about Albanian history
while we were walking.

We met up with the Albanian team (including Lauren) at 7.  It was the first time
I'd seen Erjona & Gesi since being back in Tirana, which was nice!  The others
I'd already had the opportunity to say hi to when I was around the office last
week.  We had a good meal and everyone got to know each-other, and then from
there went straight back to the hotel to get to sleep early.

# Day 2
<h2 id="July-8" class="hidden-xs">Monday July 8</h2>

You never know if a travel-recovery day is a success unless everyone wakes up
on-time the next morning!  Well, we all got up with time to spare, even though
we did joke a bit with Brian about his sleeping habits.  We made it down to the
office at 10:30 for orientation.  We started with a big meeting with all the
team and Berti & Adelina Berhami, the national directors.  We also got to meet
a couple from Granbury, TX which has been partnering with CRU in the Ukraine and
is looking to partner with CRU again in Albania.

<div class="data-img">
	<img src="/.640x/images/albania/2019/07_ministry_timeline.jpg"
    alt="Berti showing us the ministry timeline"></img>
</div>

Berti & Adelina took us upstairs to teach us about the history of CRU Albania,
showing us their timeline wall which they got to commemorate the 20th anniversary
of CRU in Albania back in 2012.  Then we went into the partnerships office and
put pins in the map to mark where we are from.  I stuck a pin into Washington, DC
because my parents who live there support some Albanian staff members.

After the cultural orientation we hopped in some taxis to the Teleferik
(cable-car), which took us up the side of Mount Dajti.  From the top you could
see the entire city.  We had lunch at Ballkoni Dajtit, a restaurant overlooking
the city.  The air was nice and clean, and the food was really good!  You could
barely make out Tirana though in the mid-summer haze.

    alt="Tirana from Mount Dajti"></img>
  <span>The view from Mount Dajti</span>
</div>

We had a prayer time there, praying over the project and the city, that the city
would come to know the Lord.  I enjoyed praying over the city from up high,
being able to take it all in at once.  After praying we built a little monument
with stones that we found lying around.  The stones represent our faith that God
will move in this city this week.

At 6pm we went to an evening prayer meeting organized to give our Albanian non-staff
partners a chance to meet us and get an idea of how the week will look.  I got
to see a whole bunch of friends whom I hadn't seen in a year, including Enerik,
Anida, Ana, Anila, Kristiana, and Mira.

Brian gave a short devotional on Numbers 13 and 14.  The Israelites, even though
they had seen God moving to save them before, lost faith when they saw the
obstacles God had placed in the Promised Land.  They said things like, "If only
we had never left Egypt!".  God wanted them to have faith in Him, that He would
defeat their enemies, but because they didn't believe in Him, He caused them to
wander the desert and miss out on the fruits, milk, and honey that was available.
Just so with us, maybe asking our co-worker to come to the meeting feels like a
giant obstacle.  But God is asking us to have faith.

After the devotional we had some extended prayer time.  We prayed over the speakers,
and the retreat, and the coffees that we would be setting up.  We also prayed for
the political situation in Albania.  That evening was to be a protest in the
center of the city.  We prayed for peace and a calm resolution to the political
grievances that people are feeling.

When the prayer meeting wrapped up, we all felt ready to take on the week! But
we could also hear the protest getting started.  So we ended up going out to eat
at a spot decently far away from the protest, and then taking the long way back
to our hotel so as to avoid getting swept up in it.  It definitely seemed like a
lot of people taking part.  Pray that it doesn't end up causing issues for the
seminars this week.

# Day 3
<h2 id="July-9" class="hidden-xs">Tuesday July 9</h2>

Today the team took a sightseeing trip to Kruja.  Gesi and his two kids took them
on a tour of the castle where Skenderbeg used to live.  It was good bonding time
where the team got to know Gesi a little better.  However, since I've been to
Kruja several times and also know Gesi pretty well, I decided it was better to
go meet up with some friends I hadn't seen in a while who were in the city today.

First off John and I took some time in the morning to go to a coffee shop and
have a quiet time.  This is something that is still fairly unusual in Albania -
but we'd like to help them build more of a habit of opening their bible at their
morning coffee.  We had a good hour and a half before the bus came.  I've been
reading Psalms & thinking more about Justice, how the population longs for the
Justice that the Lord brings.

<div class="data-img">

  <span>The Bartender saw we were Americans</span>
</div>

I also had scheduled a haircut for 10am at Gedis' favorite barber.  I told him
I need to look professional for my presentation tomorrow, and that I trust him.
In the end it looked pretty great!  But it's definitely the shortest I've ever
gotten it cut.

Since I was in the area I thought I'd stop by the co-working space that I worked
at last year and see if they were there.  Unfortunately they'd apparently moved.
I was unable to find them on Google Maps.  This was a bummer as I was looking
forward to talking to Edison again.

I got coffee with Egli at 1:30, and since Rivelino happened to be in the area he
and Ari joined us for a bit.  We had a nice long conversation, ranging from
studies to Egli's business plan, and touching on dating & how to ask girls out.
After Rivelino and Ari left, Egli and I walked around a bit and he showed me the
new free co-working space that the city of Tirana has put together.  It was pretty
nice looking but didn't seem very quiet.  We chatted also about conflict resolution
while we were there and I had the opportunity to pray for him as well, right next
to the ping-pong table of the co-working space.  This was definitely the right
decision to not go to kruja.

We all arrived back at the hotel about 3:30, and then at 4:30 Joanne and I went
over to the office.  She spent some time working with the translater going over
what she'd say tonight, and I got the opportunity to go over my presentation with
Fabi.  He had some really good suggestions that I'll incorporate tomorrow.  I'm
feeling a lot more confident about it now, even though I'm still a bit anxious.
Once it's over I'll feel a lot better about the rest of the week.

The meeting felt like a normal Sotmeria meeting, with the normal activities &
drinks and everyone who I remember being involved as a partner/volunteer from
before.  I enjoyed it, especially not being so directly involved in all the
planning and organization of it.  Joanne did a great job with her presentation.
She talked about principles of success in business and wisdom for life.  She
spoke especially powerfully to the women in the audience, who are looking for
someone to look up to.  After the meeting she already had about 8 coffees lined
up with various people!

I was a bit overwhelmed by all the coffees since I've been tasked together with
Mira Bita to keep track of Joanne's schedule.  So I was messaging some people
who gave her their phone number to confirm appointments.  Fortunately Brian took
command of organizing the post-meeting plans.  He and John also did a great job
of meeting all the guys who were at the meeting, so we should have plenty of
opportunity for them to have coffees with people.

We went to dinner at the chinese restaurant up the street, and invited both Mira
and Berti.  It was a nice relaxed dinner, with a lot of just laughing and enjoying
eachother's company.  We've been joking that Brian should get an Albanian two-
headed eagle shaved into the side of his head at the barber.  I told him that if
he wanted to do that I would do it too, and I'd even go first.  He's not quite
ready to say yes to that, but we're still working on him!

# Day 4
<h2 id="July-10" class="hidden-xs">Wednesday July 10</h2>

We all got together this morning at the office at 10am to debrief from the meeting
last night.  Priscilla did a good job with the devotional, talking about 2
Corinthians 12 and the need to boast about our weaknesses.  We also had a bit of
an evaluation of the meeting last night and what things we can improve going
forward.

We spent a lot of time after that going through the comment cards from last
night and figuring out Joanne's schedule.  So many people want to meet with her
that it's difficult to fit everyone in.  We filled up her schedule and then
began to send out more messages to people to see if they wanted to have coffee
with any of us.  Most of the people on my contacts list now have left the country.
I messaged one guy who's in America and another guy who happened to be in London.

Since John, Brian, and I didn't have any immediate coffees, we went out for lunch
at the Crepe place nearby.  I think it was Brian's first lunch crepe, but he
seemed to enjoy it!  We went with Fabi and Genti, and talked about the big storm
that was hitting our Team Elbasan friends at the beach resort in Tale.  Apparently
the storm reached it's peak in the middle of the night and they had to evacuate
all the kids out of the tents and into the hotel!  Some pretty nasty stuff, but
it led to good time of sharing about Jesus with the kids.

After lunch we took Brian to get a haircut, and then I went to have a coffee
with Pal & Ueda.  I always enjoy having coffee with them and am looking forward
to their visit to the States in October.  John and Brian came by the coffe shop
afterwards and hung out for a while.  I also messaged another friend to stop by
but he was too far away and I needed to get back and get changed for the meeting.

I went back to the hotel and got ready by about 5:15, but then the thunderstorm
started rolling in here in Tirana as well.  We ended up walking all the way to
the office in the rain.  Fortunately I had remembered to pack my raincoat.  We
arrived at the office about quarter till 6, so I had time to calm down a bit and
prepare myself mentally for the task ahead.  I was still feeling a bit nervous
about speaking in front of the whole group of people.

When it finally came time for me to go up there, I was definitely still nervous,
but that left me as soon as I started speaking!  I think just that there were
enough people praying for me that God empowered me to speak clearly and without
getting stuck, even as I spoke in Albanian.  I was very thankful afterwards that
God chose to give me eloquence, and not to humble me by having me make a fool out
of myself.

After the meeting I heard that five people had written on their comment cards that
they accepted Jesus!  We got to celebrate this good news over dinner, or at least
most of us did.  Joanne and Brian had left immediately after the meeting to have
a coffee with Marin.

Marin seems very interested in Jesus, but he's a very intellectual guy and is
not going to make any rash decisions.  He's slowly considering giving his life
over to Jesus.  I think this is very wise on his part - it shows he understands
exactly what it will mean for him.  It sounds like Joanne and Brian did a great
job of clarifying that and figuring out what is still keeping him from Christ.
I hope that he comes tomorrow to the dinner, and will be praying that the Lord
opens his eyes to everything he has to gain in Christ.

# Day 5
<h2 id="July-11" class="hidden-xs">Thursday July 11</h2>

Coffee day!  I started with an early morning coffe with a friend named Xhentil.
He's a believer who works as a software developer doing website design.  He and
his wife own their own business together.  It's difficult in Albania and they
end up working long hours but are hoping to be more active at church in the future.

From there I went to the office, where we chilled out for a while and sent people
off to various coffee appointments.  I had one with Afrim and Marsel to talk about
digital strategies and future opportunities for helping CRU Albania integrate websites
with their follow-up workflow.  A very productive partnership meeting.

There was also an opportunity for a conflict resolution conversation at lunch.
This is another area where we hope to be able to serve well and build relationships.
Rather than allowing percieved conflict to fester we are seeking to deepen
our relationships with staff and eachother by bringing it out into the open.  It
was a very good conversation and we all ended up on the same side trying to figure
out how to best care for a girl who is not yet ready to accept Christ.

After lunch I had a couple more coffees, and then we got ready for the dinner.
We had invited a number of people who were not yet believers to dinner, in order
to hear John and Joanne share their testimonies.  The dinner was very good, I got
to know several new Albanian young professionals whom I had not met before.  We
played a game where we took turns asking each other interesting questions.

John and Joanne then got up and each shared their testimonies.  It was very good.
Joanne ran long, and unfortunately some Albanians had to go, but on the whole I
think the story affected them.  I'm praying it will cause some to stop and consider
who is this Jesus that can change such a life.  I hope they will also learn from
her story that their problems are not solved if they just move to America.

I had the opportunity to dig deeper with the young man seated next to me, who is
a lawyer.  He and I talked for a good while about what God's purpose was in causing
the holy books (Bible, Quran, etc.) to be written.  I told him there's a higher
purpose than simply laying down rules for humans to follow in order to be civilized.
I got the opportunity to share the four spiritual laws and challenged him to read
the Gospel of John.  He promised that he would, and even began to download the
Bible app on his phone.

After he left, I looked around and noticed that many of the Albanians were still
there at dinner.  There were several small groups of people gathered around talking
till very late about Jesus.  I was very glad and said a prayer of thanks to God
that He caused so many Albanians to want to hang out till so late.  Marin also
stayed late and continued to talk to John & Joanne.  Continue praying for him that
he would actually come to a point of decision instead of simply "buffering" in
his words.

By the time dinner was over, several of us were so tired that we went straight
to bed. The coffee days are always the most exhausting, and also the most
rewarding.  I think this might have been one of the best opportunities we've had
with the young professionals to share with so many people personally about Jesus.

# Day 6
<h2 id="July-12" class="hidden-xs">Friday July 12</h2>

Travel day to Divjakë!  The morning for me was very restful.  I got away for a
bit to the Stephen Center, one of the few christian-run businesses in Tirana,
for my morning coffee.  I didn't have any meetings until noon so it was a good
opportunity to just relax and read the psalms for a bit.

At noon Joanne and I joined Afrim and his wife Lavdi for lunch at Zgara Korçare,
one of my favorite places to eat in Albania!  They especially wanted to meet
Joanne to talk to her about digital strategy.  There's still a lot of beginning
stuff that we have to deal with before we even get into Joanne's realm of
strategic thinking, but she gave Afrim a great pep-talk, challenging him to
stand up and change the way the organization thinks.  We need now to translate
some of that into tactics that will work, to convince the rest of the organization
of the value in leveraging the digital realm.  But in the meanwhile Afrim is now
convinced that he needs to develop a strategy that does not rely on the rest
of the organization getting on board.

I had to leave a bit early (1:45) to meet my friend Teodor, whom I met through
Egli.  We had a good conversation at coffee near the hotel.  He's looking for
opportunities to apply to graduate school in the US, but wondering if it's
worth the money.  I totally understand his perspective in wanting to leave
Albania, but at the same time I feel bad that so many young people have this
desire.  I asked him how he's doing spiritually, and he told me that he'd like
to get involved in Sotmeria again but just hasn't made that commitment recently.
I told him I'll connect him with Genti Tupa so that they can meet and he can
get involved in Sotmeria again, in order to work on his spiritual needs.

At 4 we loaded up to go to the office and meet the bus.  We rented a big bus for
the 25ish albanians plus americans to get to the retreat.  It was about a two
hour drive before we arrived in Divjakë, but we got there safe and sound even
though we felt a couple times like we were about to roll over!  After check-in
I went to a coffee with Brian, John, and Ryan.  Ryan is the speaker this weekend.
He's the director of the Institute of Biblical Studies in Budapest, which sends
seminary-trained CRU staff to do seminary level courses in various CRU offices
around eastern europe.  He'll be leading the teaching from the Bible this
weekend and I'm looking forward to hearing from him!

Dinner was from 7-8, which turned into 7:30-8:30, which is unfortunate because
that's right when the sun sets here!  I managed to sneak out and snap a couple
pictures, but I'm going to have to make sure I can do the same tomorrow during
dinner.  The sunset is so beautiful out here.

<div class="data-img">
	<img src="/.640x/images/albania/2019/07_retreat_sunset.jpg"
    alt="Retreat sunset"></img>
</div>

After sunset we had the first session.  Ryan is speaking on "The cost (and
benefits) of Discipleship".  He made reference to Dietrich Bonhoeffer and his
book of a similar name.  Bonhoeffer lived the costs of discipleship.  What were
the benefits?  When God calls us to give something up, are we having a correct
cost/benefit analysis in our minds?  Or do we only see the cost?

In Luke 9, Jesus asks Peter "who do you say that I am?"  Peter replies, "You
are the Christ, the Son of the Living God."  Jesus then goes on to tell the
disciples how he will be given over to suffer and be executed, with a kind of
implicit "who's with me?".  That's a high cost to pay to follow Jesus.  Tonight
Ryan talked more about the costs, and I'm sure he'll discuss more of the
benefits tomorrow.

Our group discussion time ended about 10:30 pm, and most of the Albanians went
upstairs to play Jenga and Uno.  I played one round of Jenga but felt I needed
to go to sleep.  I've recently decided that I can no longer stay up late both
nights of a weekend retreat like this, so if I'm going to stay up late the
second night I need to go to sleep on time the first night!


# Day 7
<h2 id="July-13" class="hidden-xs">Saturday July 13</h2>

Today I started off by taking my bible up to the coffee shop at the resort
hotel.  I was hoping to be a little early to get some good time in the word
before everyone got up, but Berti and Genti were already there having a coffee.
I figured why not, sat down with them and got a chance to really have some good
time with a couple good friends.

We talked about life, what we're learing
from God, and also a bit about girls.  The situation in Albania is that guys
often feel they can't ask out girls around the church, for fear that if it doesn't
go well then they will end up ostracized or judged for it.  There's a lot of
expectation once it gets out there that you're dating someone.  It's really
unfortunate cause the girls that are part of Sotmeria would be an amazing catch
for any one of our guys.

We had the first session of the day, and continued talking about the cost of
discipleship.  Ryan told us about the life of Jim Elliot, how he counted the cost
and chose to live a full life rather than a long one.  "He is no fool who gives
what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose."  Ryan then suggested four
key meanings of "taking up your cross daily":
* Opposition
* Shame
* Suffering
* Death

Of those four I think the one Albanians have the hardest time dealing with is
shame.  Often they are judged by non-believers for believing in "fairy tales".
Other times they are judged even inside the church for not living up to the
"standard".  So they put on masks.  We discussed in our small group afterwards
how we can start to bear our cross in the shame aspect, even in church, in order
to live in obedience to Christ.

After our coffee break, the second session we split up the guys and gals.  John
excellently presented the 6 community core values to the guys and challenged
them to find a group of brothers with whom they can practice confession & holding
each-other accountable.  There's a general consensus that they want something
like this, but it's hard to put it into practice.  Someone has to go first.

The rest of the day was for fun and hanging out together.  I went out to the
beach with Ryan to try to get some Albanians to come play Spikeball.  But it
seemed noone was interested, so after a half-hour I went back and hung out by
the pool where most of my friends were.  I had a nice half-nap poolside, which
was very refreshing.  I was very glad to have that free time in the middle of
the day.  This project has been pretty tiring and I'll honestly be glad when I
can go home and rest.

<div class="data-img">
	<img src="/.640x/images/albania/2019/07_dancing.jpg"
    alt="Dancing at the Retreat"></img>
</div>

The evening was for dancing and games.  Unfortunatly a storm rolled in so we
had to do it inside, but honestly I think that made it better cause everyone was
forced into closer proximity with each-other.  We did a bunch of Albanian dances,
but unfortunately I couldn't dance the Valle e Kukesit (my favorite one)
because of my knee.  Valle e Kukesit is very fast and involves jumping and
landing on your right leg, which is the one that I tore my ACL playing ultimate.

I watched most of the dances and participated in some of the slow ones (with my
knee brace on of course).  It was a lot of fun as always.  We danced till almost
midnight, and Rexhep went through two different shirts getting them completely
drenched in sweat.  This is always one of my favorite parts of the trip.

Since everyone was completely exhausted from the dancing we all went to bed, no
Uno or Jenga tonight.

# Day 8
<h2 id="July-14" class="hidden-xs">Sunday July 14</h2>

The final day of the retreat (and of our trip!) started early.  I was up at 7:30
to go have some quiet time before everything started, but apparently that was
not early enough!  I was halfway through when at about 10 till 8 a big group
of Albanians came up to the coffee shop at the resort, and invited me to sit
with them.  They were gracious enough to allow me to finish my quiet time before
joining them.

The coffee went as normal coffees do, we chatted about random
things and then Genti tupa asked each of us what we have been reading in the
Bible.  Nice touch, Genti.  A couple of us have been reading in the psalms, and
I got to share how I have had difficulty connecting emotionally with the psalms
in the past.  Even today I have to put in real effort to understand the emotions
of the author.

The morning session, after we had breakfast, was about the benefits of being a
disciple.  Ryan began by showing us a video about Joni Eareckson Tada, whom God
is using to display how He satisfies our desires even when we don't have anything
that our flesh might consider "the good life".  I think that was very powerful.
He talked a lot about treasures in heaven, bringing up 1 Timothy 6 and Matthew
6:19-21.  I hope the Albanians will begin to truly think long-term and consider
the benefits when they are thinking about the costs of following Jesus.

Our discussion time was also very good.  We talked about counting our blessings,
one girl suggested that she'd like to start writing down instances where she sees
God bringing blessings into her life.  Practicing gratitude is a good way to
become aware of God's blessings, and to begin seeing the benefits of following
Christ.  I brought up Psalms 34:8 and Malachi 3:10, and asked the group to test
God in this - whether He will not reward them for being faithful.  Be faithful
in a little, and then practice gratitude and discover how faithful God is in
return.

After our coffee break, Ryan gave a session on bible study methods.  He had some
really interesting points about observation.  He showed us some illustrations,
using videos like this one to make a point about opening our eyes to see more.

< gorilla video here >

He made the point that we should also pray that God open our eyes to see more of
what He has to say in the Bible.  This is the point of one of David's psalms.

And with that the retreat was over.  We hung out for a while at lunch, and the
bus wasn't coming till 4, but the rest was free time.  I spent it hanging out at
the pool.  I would have liked to have had a coffee with Genti, but being the
servant that he is, he was driving people to and from a boating excursion the
entire time.

I did fortunately get to spend some more time with Berti.  I really enjoy hanging
out with him, he's one of my best friends in Albania.  I'd like to be able to
move back here someday, not just to spend time with him, but especially to be
part of his life and others' lives.  But for now God is sending some pretty
clear signals that I should be in Dallas for a while longer.

We got back into Tirana at about 7:15 PM, and the Americans said goodbye to the
Albanians who were on the bus.  We then went out for dinner at Era, one of our
favorite restaurants.  We had an evaluation of the project there, since Lauren
joined us and could relay the evaluation back to the Albanian staff.  On the whole
we had more positive things than negative things.  Looking forward to next year
and seeing how things change.

On the point of evaluation, we've also been considering what role we should play
as the American team.  We no longer want to just be the people who come and do
whatever project the Albanian team lays out for us to do.  We're considering how
we can serve the Albanians in a deeper way.  Perhaps that includes more
discipleship opportunities, perhaps some admonishment and having harder
conversations.  We feel now that we have the relational capital to begin being
the "friend who is closer than a brother".  I think this may also entail turning
this into a year-round ministry project, rather than a 6 month ramp-up to summer
projects.  We discussed all of this late into the night with Lauren.

After dinner we went out to dessert and met up with Afrim, Gedis, and Çeli.  It
was nice having them send us off.  We had a fun time catching up and discussing
when it will be possible to get back to Albania.  For me, the sooner the better.

Till next time,
