# Day 1
<h2 id="Jul-1" class="hidden-xs">Sunday July 1</h2>

We traveled overnight Friday, finally arriving Saturday night.  After checking into the hotel I was beat.  I went to sleep right away and managed to sleep 9 hours straight.  It was good though to see Berti, Pal, Ueda, and Aldo, who all picked us up at the airport.

Berti invited me to his bible study group before church.  I met up with them at 8am at Mon Cheri.  Berti, Xhulio, Zamir, Visi, and Landi have been meeting regularly to study the Bible.  They were talking about Psalm 58 this week, and we discussed the contrast between "The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;" (v10) and Jesus' words: "Love your enemies and proy for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44).  I'm glad to see those guys getting together to dig into God's word!

From there we went to Church at 10 am.  I spent some time saying hi to as many people as I could find!  It's great to be back, it almost feels like coming home.  It's been a while since I've been able to sing worship songs in Albanian, though I have once or twice played some Albanian worship off of YouTube back in Dallas.

The sermon was on Acts 15.  Gusti Prenga did a great job talking about the freedom we have in the Gospel.  His opening hook was a play on the name of Lionel Messi, who had just lost in the knockout stage of the World Cup.  He said, "A eshte Mesia mjaft?" - Is the Messiah enough?  For Argentina it seems the answer was No.

But for us the answer is Yes.  The context is that some former pharisees were arguing that believers need to be circumcised, and so to adopt the entire law of Moses.  But in verse 28 the leadership decided "not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements...".  The law is a burden.  But we have freedom from that burden.  Christ took the burden that we cannot bear.

One point was particularly insightful.  He said that of all the groups in the world, we Christians have to be the most flexible with cultural differences.  Too often we confuse our culture, our way of doing things, with the Gospel.  We have to be careful to not place an undue burden on others.

Lunch after church was pretty good too, I got to sit next to Egli.  He's about to move to Portugal for a job.  I'm hoping to get some coffee with him this week or next to help him prepare spiritually.  He just got baptized with the Church on June 10!  I'm glad for him.

We went out with Gesi Qiriazi afterwards to watch the World Cup.  We had a great time just chilling at this new coffee bar.  He said that the owner wants to plant a church as well, and use the coffee bar to support his ministry.  I'll happily keep buying drinks there, it's a great location with a beautiful outdoor section.  They also have Oreo shakes.  I didn't get one but I wanted to.  Instead I had my first Fanta Exotic of the trip.

We had dinner at Era, just the American team.  We discussed the schedule for the week just a little bit, but mostly we just hung out with Lauren, whom we haven't seen in a good while!  It was definitely fun catching up with her.  We've been taking it easy this first day, which I think was the right decision.  Some of us had to work extra before we left just to take this time off to come here.  Tomorrow we'll hit the ground running.  Mark already has messaged a couple guys for coffee, and it seems that Bela & the Sotmeria girls are working on setting up coffees for the ladies.

# Day 2
<h2 id="Jul-2" class="hidden-xs">Monday July 2</h2>

I started the second day at Mon Cheri again, where I got some good quality time with the Lord.  I'm glad to have
that place, which feels a bit like home.  I met Arti Cana up there for a coffee before we got started for the
day.  He's on staff with the student ministry, which is going well but is a little slow this year.  We talked
about how that might be a good time then to devote to prayer, that God might reveal some things to them
they need to change.  He agreed, and said that they are definitely praying.

At 10am we all arrived at the office for the orientation.  Aldo has gotten really good at giving the cultural
orientation.  I didn't feel like anything was left out, and the rookies were quite satisfied.  There were few
questions.  We then split up into teams, and the young professionals team went over the schedule for the week.
We're trying to get in as many coffees as possible before the first seminar, so that we can be ready for those
who show up at the seminars.

After lunch Mark and I went to Cafe D'Anvers near the hotel to wait for our first coffee.  Unfortunately he was
a no-show, so we went back to take a nap.  Our second coffee was also at D'Anvers, we met Albi and Joana
right outside the hotel and made the quick walk to coffee.  Mark and Amber had met with them last year,
and Mark wanted to follow up to see how they were doing.

We talked mostly about community and service, while also watching the World Cup on the screen behind us.
They have been in a community group led by Pal, but they are the only married couple in the group, which
has been a challenge.  They thought about getting involved with a small group with the other married couples
but it never worked out.  They both have difficult work schedules which makes it tough to connect with
the groups.  One thing they agreed on is that they want to serve more at the church.  Joana talked about
the joy she felt the last time she went to serve with the kids in Hamalaj, a place where Cornerstone has
planted a church and helps support the believers there.  She'd like more of that joy, so we discussed
her maybe joining with the children's ministry.

After finishing coffee, we met up with the others at the office for the prayer meeting.  Lauren and Alba
led the meeting, giving us a lot of topics to pray about together with accompanying scriptures.  We prayed
that the Lord would open the hearts of the people coming to our seminars, just as He did for Lydia.

> One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper
> of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.
> <span class="source"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esv/acts/16.htm">Acts 16:14</a></span>

I'm glad that we decided to do the prayer night again this year.  I think it's one of the most
important things we do, and I'm glad that Bela had the idea to start up a prayer group for the
ministry a year ago.  It's been very effective.

We all went to dinner, the Albanians together with the Dallas and Florida teams, at Floga restaurant.
I ended up on the quiet end of the table, but enjoyed talking with Dan.  He's a civil engineer
who now directs operations for a Florida county.  His kids are all grown and mostly moved out
of the house.  His wife is currently working on a PhD, but when she's done with that they're
open to the possibility of moving somewhere overseas to do missions work.  I asked what it
would take to get him to move to Albania.  He said in essence it would need to be a God thing,
so I told him I'd be praying for that.

# Day 3
<h2 id="Jul-3" class="hidden-xs">Tuesday July 3</h2>

We got started a bit later today.  It gave me a bit of extra quiet time in the morning, at a nearby
cafe.  It was good to get that prayer time in for the seminar tonight.  At 11am we met at the office
and shared about what's been encouraging for us so far.  I shared about Zamir, who was with us in
the prayer meeting last night.  It's encouraging to me how much he's grown in his faith since
he came to Christ a year and a half ago.

After the morning meeting, once we were all on the same page regarding everyone's schedules, we all
went out to lunch down in the Bllok.  We sat down at a place with outdoor seating, and we noticed
a guy with a Dallas t-shirt!  Me, Will, and Lauren went up to talk to him.  He didn't speak any
English, and had never been to America, he just liked the shirt.  His name is Geni, and he's a delivery
driver.  We told him about our ministry & the theme of Mark's talk tonight, which is "Leaving a Legacy".
He said that his legacy was centered around his family.  He wants his kids to be able to get better jobs
than he has.  I said that's a good legacy to leave.  He unfortunately couldn't come to the seminar tonight
but I got his phone number.  I'll try to follow up in the next couple weeks.

We moved on from lunch to the spot where Mark and I were to meet Dorian, while the ladies
decided to go shopping for souvenirs and jewelry.  Mark picked up a souvenir soccer ball
for his son Titus outside of Toptani center, which is the brand new shopping mall in downtown
Tirana.  We wandered around a bit, and connected with Dorian at 2pm.

When we met Dorian last year, he was a student at a Madrasa studying Islamic sciences.  Since then
he's apparently been out of the country working in Luxembourg and France.  It seems he's finished
his undergrad work but is not going to pursue a masters.  We caught him while he's in town a couple
days before returning to his hometown of Korce.

Our discussion quickly turned to spiritual things, thanks to Mark.  Mark was trying to show from the
old testament how we are separated from God due to sin, how our good deeds are worthless for trying
to reconcile us back to God, and how Jesus needed to suffer the punishment for us.  When we got to
Isaiah 53, it was surprising to us how quickly Dorian picked up on the fact that the "He" in the
prophecy refers to Jesus.  He seemed to be between agreement and disagreement, so I tried a different
tack.

I began to show him how in the old testament, the punishment for sin was death.  I asked him if he
believed that Jesus actually died.  He said that in Islam they have a different tradition, that it
wasn't Jesus but really Judas who died on the cross.  He wasn't sure that it's correct that the
punishment for our sins has to be death.  He told us that he'd have to talk about it with others
who are more wise than he is.  I've seen this before with Muslims, they tend to take a higher
view of authority than American Christians and they'll want to talk things over with someone
that they see as an authority rather than come to a decision on their own about some point
of theology.  Please pray for Dorian as he processes all of this.

After our great conversation with Dorian, Mark went back to the hotel to get ready for his talk
while I went to meet Egli.  Egli is getting ready to move to Portugal for a great work opportunity
and I want to help make sure he's spiritually prepared.  We just kind of hung out for a while
and talked a little about spiritual health.  We'll have to have a few more conversations on that
topic.  However he did say that he wanted to share the Gospel with his friend, whom he also invited
to the seminar tonight.  I helped him download the GodTools app so that he could have an easy
way to share the 4 spiritual laws, rather than struggling through trying to remember himself.

The seminar was great!  I got to see a whole bunch of people that I hadn't seen in a while,
many of the Sotmeria regulars like Ira, Ina, Andrea, Rexhep & others.  We had a quick icebreaker
game and then Mark went into his seminar.  He spoke on "Leaving a legacy", and compared a
personal legacy to a fruit tree.  I could see the biblical parallels that he chose to leave
implicit.  He talked about having a personal mission statement, which is a great idea that
I don't think many of the Albanians have considered.  I hope that the idea of a personal
mission statement will prompt many of them to talk to Sotmeria staff or volunteers, to help
them develop their mission statement.

Mark also shared about SMART goals, ones that are Specific Measurable Attainable x x.
I think this information was very helpful to those Albanians who are motivated already
to improve their skills and their careers.  I wonder how it landed with the ones who
aren't quite as motivated.

After the seminar I heard from Egli that he had in fact shared the 4 spiritual laws
with his friend!  I was so excited to hear that.  Even though his friend did not accept
Christ, Egli had been faithful to share his faith.  That's the most important thing,
we leave the results up to God.  Egli is already a multiplying disciple.  I will
keep praying for him, that his faith would continue to grow both here and in Portugal.

We went to dinner at a burger restaurant and had good conversation with Berti and Egli.
It was a little difficult for me being the only translator, but fortunately while I was
busy Berti and Claudia managed to communicate some via Google Translate.  We made some
good jokes about that, and other misunderstandings that Berti has had with Lauren over
the past year.  It was a fun end to the evening, and we're ready to continue working
hard tomorrow.

# Day 4
<h2 id="Jul-4" class="hidden-xs">Wednesday July 4</h2>

This morning I was reading Acts 4.  I've been reading through the early chapters of Acts on this
trip, because the same God who worked through the Apostles in the book of Acts also works in us.
Jesus promised, "Greater works than these you will do".  I have been praying this week that,
just like the early church, we would be continually in awe of what God is doing here.  And
every year since we first came in 2013 I have not been disappointed.  God never fails to move,
He has been working miracles in people's hearts every summer.

We came together at 10am to pray over all the names that we collected after the seminar last night.
We shared some stories of how we've seen God moving so far, and then divided into groups to
pray for the Gospel presentation tonight, and for all the meetings we would have.  And then,
right as Mark was praying over the seminar tonight, an earthquake hit!  Earthquakes are
unusual but not unheard of here.  In my 2 years living in Albania I experienced 3 or 4
that were strong enough to be easily felt.  This one was definitely one of those.  The building
shook a bit but noone was in any danger.  Mark then said that it reminded him of the verse in
Acts 4,

> 
> <span class="source"><a href="http://biblehub.com/nasb/acts/4.htm">Acts 4:31</a></span>

I'm thankful for a God who always leaves us with a sense of awe.

After the prayer time we divided up the contact information of the new people who came to
last night's seminar and attempted to contact them.  Unfortunately we couldn't call them
due to the earthquake causing issues with the phone networks, so I left a few text messages
and I'll call them again tomorrow.  Mark and I then left to grab some crepes on the way
to our first meeting.

We met with a guy named Endri H.  He owns a Tae-Kwon-Do gym and is also trying to start up
a rec center with all sorts of gymnastics, rock climbing, etc.  He hopes to use that as
some kind of after school program, and as an opportunity to share his faith.  One area
that he's having difficulty is in balancing sharing his faith with running his business.  He
finds that sharing his faith can drive away paying customers.  We encouraged him however that
we think his heart is in the right place.

He asked Mark for advice in marketing, because Mark works in negotiating sponsorship deals
for sports teams and has experience in this field.  It's difficult to give concrete advice
for the Albanian context, especially because there's so much corruption and protectionism around
these various industries that it's hard for an outsider to really break in.  At the same time,
as we were talking it became pretty clear that he's not really running his business as a separate
entity.  Maybe some basic finance courses would be of greater help to him.  I offered to connect
him to Ilir, who leads Sotmeria's ministry to business leaders.  Maybe this would be a good
chance for him to learn from other business leaders, to improve his business, and also to join
with someone else who has a vision for transforming Albania through the Gospel.

After that I met up with Claudia and Enddrit.  Enddrit is a believer who is occasionally
involved with Sotmeria, but is not one of the key volunteers. He is going through a transition in his
work situation and exploring the idea of using his degree, which is in the field of oil &
gas exploration.  Unfortunately to really make use of this, he has to leave Albania to go
work for a foreign company in one of the harsh areas of the world where the majority of oil
rigs are.  This is a challenge because Enddrit doesn't speak any other languages.  Claudia
challenged him to follow Mark's advice from the seminar last night, and to set some SMART
goals for learning either English or Spanish.  She will also send him some links to oil
and gas companies that he can apply to.

After this I needed a break, because I had been translating for almost 4 hours.  I've been
praying that God would use me in whatever way, but also to remind me that it's not about me -
"as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk" (Acts 3:?).  The Lord has been
reminding me of that by putting me in the translator role for most of these coffees.  The
Albanians are wanting to talk to Mark, Claudia, or other Americans, not so much to me, which
is OK.  I don't need to be the center of their attention in order to serve the way God has
resourced me.  I mentioned to Mark that I think God has preserved my language skills through
this year in America for precisely this reason, to be a good and needed translator on this trip.

After resting a bit I met up with Mark and Enddrit.  We talked soccer for a while and generally
just hung out until the seminar.  The seminar was packed tonight, there were around 100 people who
came which is unusual for a spiritual seminar.  Chris did a great job of weaving in multiple stories
into his Gospel presentation.  He started from a position of humility, talking about his own struggles
with pornography and his marital difficulties early on, before he and his wife really committed
themselves to Christ.  He used that as a way to emphasize the necessity of the decision, that you
need to make that decision to follow Christ.  This is the 4th spiritual law in the 4 spiritual
laws booklet - that you have to make a personal decision.

The one worry I have is that Albanians generally are not willing to talk about their weaknesses.
They feel pre-judged by others when they share something personal like what Chris shared.
But I also hope that through this some will be prompted to examine themselves and see that
there is a need for something, a need to share about their weaknesses or to accept that they
are sinners in need of grace.

I talked to one non-believer afterwards about the message, and
mentioned this aspect of Chris' talk.  Then I asked him if he had any weaknesses for which he
might need God's grace.  He said he didn't have any, essentially that all his weaknesses were 
normal and not particularly bad.  I told him that I used to feel the same way, until I found
a point of reference outside myself.  It's only when you find that external point of reference
that you are able to see where you yourself don't measure up.  Chris has a meeting with
this guy tomorrow, I hope he will follow up on this line of questioning.

After the meeting many people had already scheduled coffees, so just a few of us ended up
going to Zgara Korcare.  It was me, Lauren, Fabi, Mark, Chris, Andrew, and Lori.  We talked
a lot about the various aspects of membership at Watermark, about service and community in
the Church, and even about how elders are selected at Watermark and at Generations church
(where Chris, Andrew, and Lori are members).  Andrew also told us about his desire to move
with his wife to the mission field somewhere overseas.  It seems they are strongly considering
Albania!

After dinner I was glad for the long walk home to help the food settle.  We got to the hotel
around 11:30 and hit the sack pretty quickly after that.
