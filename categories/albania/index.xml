&lt;h2 id="Jul-2" class="hidden-xs">Saturday July 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After an 11 hour overnight flight, a 7 hour layover, and multiple last-minute
passport issues, we made it! As it turned out, two of our team members were
unable to get their passports or travel documents in time for the flight. But
the Lord is sovereign over that too, and He has a reason for everything He does.
We are thankful that He allowed 10 of us to get over here!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal • 2021</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 00:36:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2021/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="day-1">Day 1&lt;/h1>

&lt;li>Great things in and around Elbasan - lots of opportunity to share the Gospel,
some Elbasan kids becoming key volunteers which is unusual b/c they are more Muslim typically&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Re:Gen camp was good. Gedis decided he wanted to do Re:gen b/c of Berti Berhami sharing his testimony&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allye went to sleep, I stayed up for the Fier team&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="day-5">Day 5&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="Oct-16" class="hidden-xs">Thursday Sept 23&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rest morning - rolled out of bed at 9:30
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Allye felt so much better&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the group went for brunch and then walked around the city.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allye and I took a taxi up to &amp;ldquo;Bar Class&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>12:00 - met at the office to prepare for the &amp;ldquo;World Game&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1:00 - coffee w/ Brian and Luka
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Believer, grew up in a Christian family.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Interested in Software Engineering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talked about life purpose - challenged him to think about this for a purpose: seek joy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discussed tithing and giving, not out of obligation. He had the advantage of watching his parents give 10%&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>World game
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pyramid scheme&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I shared my testimony, centered around the concept of &amp;ldquo;Right vs Wrong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Objective Morality&amp;rdquo;.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Micah 6:8&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Story re: SQL injection&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Board game time&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6:00 met with Berti and Zamir
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Berti has a new job, he had been considering leaving his old job without even having a new one lined up, but he went to the church camp and prayed with Altin, and on the way back from the church camp he had two interviews lined up!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zamir has been growing his business, he has 25 employees now and is getting a new office! The Lord has blessed them both.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I really enjoyed having a long coffee to catch up with them. I&amp;rsquo;m glad for them and praying that they will keep being involved in church, and being a light for others.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7:30 dinner at Era with Pal and Ueda. Just another great time together with friends. I love that I get to spend a lot of time with them on these trips.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="day-6">Day 6&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="Oct-17" class="hidden-xs">Friday Sept 24&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>8:30 AM went to Dajti with a fugon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stopped at Natyra e Qete, where Pal and Ueda got married&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prayer time
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Prayed over the project, specific names of kids that we had shared with or will share with&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prayed for Albania
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Justice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Corruption&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social media usage among the youth&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prayed for America
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Divided country w/ politics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Materialism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Church to be the Church&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Celebrated Edi &amp;amp; Kela&amp;rsquo;s 10 year anniversary w/ a cake&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Came down the mountain - I prayed that the brakes would hold!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coffee with Mario, Klevisa, Alexa, and Allye
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Allye talked with Klevisa and Alexa while I asked Mario some questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On a scale of 1-10 he&amp;rsquo;s a 7, because he&amp;rsquo;s confused about some things. I asked him what he&amp;rsquo;s confused about.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Why would God make others suffer because of Adam and Eve
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>He&amp;rsquo;s patient towards us, not wanting that any should perish&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why are there so many different faiths
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read paul&amp;rsquo;s sermon at the Areopagus&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purpose was to get him to see that the answers to his questions are in the bible&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alesio came later with a friend and started asking questions too, both of them said they are a 0&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Came late to the Texas Night meeting
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Andrew started off with Frank Sinatra&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Texas Trivia - the question about Sweetwater&amp;rsquo;s rattlesnake roundup got the most people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Q &amp;amp; A time - asked about Rodeo, we showed a video about mutton busting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dancing started with two stepping for 3 songs, then &amp;ldquo;Copperhead road&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;Footloose&amp;rdquo; (madison)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For Cotton-Eye Joe, we tried to teach one dance but they were already doing another one&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I went for coffee afterwards with Samuel, Luka, and Elia. Edi joined after a bit.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I shared my testimony, they appreciated the change in my life from 10 years ago&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I asked Sam to share how he became a believer
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Last year was a dark time in his life, with lots of isolation. A pastor came all the way across Tirana, even during curfew, just to talk to him. That made a huge impression on him.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Luka said that last year he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be a believer because he thought that meant he couldn&amp;rsquo;t have fun anymore. I shared that I am a &amp;ldquo;Christian Hedonist&amp;rdquo; like John Piper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Encouraging to get to invest in some young believers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Andrew went for coffee with a young boy named Alessio. He accepted christ tonight! Andrew had been working with him all week&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Met up for dinner with Berti and Adelina Berhami at Stephen Center. They treated us to dinner.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Good conversation with good friends&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sara, their daughter, took part in the re:gen camp this last weekend in Durres. Sara said that this is what we&amp;rsquo;ve been needing, since she experienced this many years ago in Dallas. Berti was studying at DTS at the time and the family were members of Watermark. Sara and Klea both went to WM youth ministry.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After dinner we took a nice walk through town and arrived safely at our hotel, and of course went directly to sleep.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="day-7">Day 7&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="Sep-25" class="hidden-xs">Saturday Sept 25&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Met with Genti Tupa early
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Had to change things up with the YP ministry, almost &amp;ldquo;starting from zero&amp;rdquo;. He&amp;rsquo;s looking to connect with the medical community now as he has a supporter who will come who is a doctor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talked about asking around our church if any lawyers would be interested in coming to Albania to make inroads with the legal community there.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Covid test time! Went to a testing site on the other side of the city
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Anxiety that one or more tests would be positive. Us all being negative would be a miracle.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allye said it best, &amp;ldquo;praying that God would help my attitude if we&amp;rsquo;re not all negative&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coffee time with Klei and Albi
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Klei is a typical high school student, he didn&amp;rsquo;t say much in response to questions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Just wants a family and a good job. We talked about having a bigger purpose for your life. He says he is a believer but hasn&amp;rsquo;t been very much involved in church. Albi is trying to get him to go to church in Yzberisht together with albi&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meeting time at 11am
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There was a funny skit about a couple who goes to the movie theater. They have to sit on opposite sides of the row, and a jerk of a guy is in between them. The boyfriend passes gifts along to his girlfriend but they all end up being eaten or somehow messed up by the jerk. Meanwhile the other guy actually sitting next to the girl presents the gifts as though they are from him, and the girlfriend ends up leaving with the other guy!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brian did an excellent job with the Gospel presentation!
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Very clear explanation of the 4 laws&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Left the final slide up for the duration of the meeting - &amp;ldquo;you must make a personal choice&amp;rdquo;. Sam said he appreciated that this slide remained up for the whole meeting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lots of dancing! Our last chance to get in all the albanian dancing we want&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lunch afterwards with about a dozen students.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Allye talked to Nertila for a while, she&amp;rsquo;s a believer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I tried to engage Igli and his brother Bruno in conversation. I asked them what they want out of life - &amp;ldquo;money&amp;rdquo;. We talked about John D Rockefeller, who when asked how much more would satisfy him, said &amp;ldquo;only 1 more dollar&amp;rdquo;. I was trying to make the point that Igli will never be satisfied, but he seemed to like that phrase. Or at least it was &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; to like that in front of his friends. I challenged him instead to seek Wisdom, and we read some from Proverbs about how wisdom is more valuable than gold and silver. Pray for him, he didn&amp;rsquo;t seem interested in taking that path.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Headed back to the office and piled into 3 cars to go out to Durres for the evening. This was our time of rest, relaxation with our Albanian friends, and evaluation of the project.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First, we toured the Roman amphitheater in Durres. It&amp;rsquo;s likely the 2nd largest ever built by Rome outside the Coliseum.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s thought that Titus was martyred here&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drove down to the beach and a nice outdoor seafood restaurant there. We walked the beach a bit and took some photos before heading in to eat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discussed the project, what went well, what we could do better.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The video was a hit, we&amp;rsquo;ll definitely have to make a better one next time. Maybe Jordan Thompson would be on board?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doing a run-through of texas night and our gospel presentation would have helped.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Praise the Lord for negative covid tests! We all got the emails at dinner. It&amp;rsquo;s seriously a miracle that none of us caught it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was good to see both new students and returning students. It&amp;rsquo;s important to invest in the believers too.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After a long and enjoyable dinner, we said goodnight to Kaon and Danjela as they were returning separately with their kids. The rest of us packed up in the cars again and went to the hotel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since our flight out was at 4am, we decided to leave the hotel at 1 to go to the airport. Pal and Genti graciously stayed up to take us there. We chilled at the hotel until 11, hanging out and checking the score of the College Football games. I was watching A&amp;amp;M v Arkansas, while Brian was trying to follow Baylor vs Iowa State&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That last night of time with our friends was hard but good. Good because we are just such good friends now. Hard because of the exhaustion, and wanting to be present to spend time with them. I already miss them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

But there&amp;rsquo;s a purpose in everything God does! Though we were sad to not see our
friends during the summer, we have kept in touch with them through a weekly Zoom
call. Through this weekly touchpoint, and God&amp;rsquo;s provision, we were able to go
as a small team in October!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My Fiancee Allye Foster and I traveled first, arriving Monday October 12 to
participate in the high school ministry&amp;rsquo;s project. We arrived about noon, very
tired from the flights. Pal picked us up at the airport and drove us to the
hotel. I was very excited to see him again, we hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen eachother since he
and Ueda came to Dallas in February.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal • 2019 - Young Professionals</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2019_youngprofessionals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2019 21:36:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2019_youngprofessionals/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-in-between">The in-between&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I had a full week in between the &lt;a href="http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2019_shkodra/">Shkoder project&lt;/a> and the YP
project. I spent half of it working remote and the rest just catching up with
friends. I found a really good coffee shop to work from. with a wonderful view.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="data-img">

&lt;h1 id="day-1">Day 1&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="July-7" class="hidden-xs">Sunday July 7&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Today my first responsibility was going to get everyone from the airport. Back
on the receiving end! I enjoy hosting and it was fun to be able to welcome
everyone and get them settled in. First thing we did was go to the hotel, where
Joanne went straight in to take a nap. Smart choice. The rest of us got up and
went out for lunch. We had Suflaqe across the street, and near the end of lunch a couple people who
thought they were OK ended up just being done. So they headed back to the hotel
while the rest of us walked around and exchanged leke, bought water, and took care
of whatever needs we could think of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal • 2019 - Shkodra</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2019_shkodra/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:36:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2019_shkodra/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Pre-trip team photo" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/albania/2019/06_shkodra_view.jpg">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We arrived in Tirana around noon and met Pal at the airport. Glad to be back in
country! It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I was here last - too long. We went with
Pal to pick up Wes and Daniel at Hotel Sokrat. While there we met with Aldo
for a bit. It was nice to catch up with him too! He&amp;rsquo;s tranisitioning to a new
role with partnerships, and Pal &amp;amp; Ueda next year will be taking over for him as leader
of the Tirana high school ministry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building on The Foundation</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2019/04_summer_projects_2019/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 14:20:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2019/04_summer_projects_2019/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid
a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how
he builds upon it. For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid,
which is Jesus Christ.
&lt;span class="source">&lt;a href="http://biblehub.com/esv/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-11&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What is it that we are building together with our partners in Albania? Why do you keep
supporting me and my team in going back, now for the 7th year in a row? Firstly
let me be clear that we are building nothing of our own, but rather we are building
on the foundation that has already been laid. CRU has already done an amazing
job of building up the Church in Albania, coming in shortly after Communism fell
armed with nothing but the Gospel. Christ through them has laid the foundation
of a small yet vibrant Church in Albania.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Acts 29</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2018/07_acts_29_in_albania/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 08:55:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2018/07_acts_29_in_albania/</guid><description>&lt;p>This month, while we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the summer project here in Albania, I&amp;rsquo;ve
been reading the book of Acts. I love all the descriptions in the book of Acts
of faithful people who were not Apostles. Some of them, like Cornelius the centurion,
had been faithful for a very long time, and God answered their prayers powefully.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in
and say to him, “Cornelius.” And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it,
Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial
before God.
&amp;hellip;
While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the
word. And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed,
because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.

&lt;p>Berti invited me to his bible study group before church. I met up with them at 8am at Mon Cheri. Berti, Xhulio, Zamir, Visi, and Landi have been meeting regularly to study the Bible. They were talking about Psalm 58 this week, and we discussed the contrast between &amp;ldquo;The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;&amp;rdquo; (v10) and Jesus&amp;rsquo; words: &amp;ldquo;Love your enemies and proy for those who persecute you&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 5:44).

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so glad that I already had a chance to get back to Albania in December,
when we put on &lt;a href="http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/12_mens_retreat/">a men&amp;rsquo;s conference for Cornerstone Church of Tirana&lt;/a>.
That was a great time of fun and fellowship with many of my close Albanian friends.

until now, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but be amazed at the way God has used this partnership to bring
change not only in my life but in the lives of my friends. My key verse for my 2-year stint
in Albania was Mark 10:29-30&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or
mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a
hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children
and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.

But even as I readjust to life in America I&amp;rsquo;m still looking back to Albania and my next opportunity to

&lt;p>And the Lord graciously provides! I will be going on a trip in December with Will Noll, Matt Rial,
Chris Hyland, and hopefully 1 to 2 others. We have been communicating with the elders of Guri i Themelit

&lt;p>All good things come to an end, and my STINT in Albania is no different. On 7 August I fly back to Dallas to spend at least 1 year there, with the hope that I&amp;rsquo;ll return to live in Albania sooner rather than later. At this point I&amp;rsquo;m holding all my plans loosely. I know what I want to do for the next year, but beyond that it&amp;rsquo;s up to God.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal • 2017</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2017/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 21:36:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2017/</guid><description>&lt;div class="data-img" style="width:100%; max-width:100%">

These past several months I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring two options for my time after my STINT is up.

The second area was an open position at Watermark Community Church as a programmer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Leadership</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2017/05_digital_leadership/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2017 13:39:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2017/05_digital_leadership/</guid><description>&lt;p>April was a fairly slow month. We had our normal schedule of a professional meeting and a social time. This month we had fewer people than normal, but we had a lot of new people which was very interesting. I&amp;rsquo;ve had several opportunities to follow up with contacts, though this appears to be a busy time of year for most of the professionals. We are trying more to model the follow-up process for our partners, inviting them into these meetings and giving them opportunities to lead. Albert has been doing a great job helping me mentor one of the new believers in the first steps of learning about his faith.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>March Project</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2017/04_march_project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2017 22:08:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2017/04_march_project/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="we-love-momentum">We love momentum&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>March 13-17 was a big week for us. We invited a group from Louisville, TX To join us for a week-long momentum building project. This group had an amazing impact, we drew in well over 100 people for the seminar, and our social time was a big success as well. We got a lot of new contacts and, as was our goal, we will be following up with them over the coming weeks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TraNet 2017</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2017/03_tranet_2017/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2017 14:36:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2017/03_tranet_2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>What a great weekend! This past weekend we went to Cyprus for a conference about reaching leaders and influencers for Christ. The group was about 28 people, including 10 professionals, 4 teachers, two businesswomen and a government worker. It was a great time of learning and inspiring our partners to reach their peers for Christ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Group pic" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2017/tranet_2017/group_pic.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One speaker was a bible teacher who took us through the book of Mark, highlighting the disciples&amp;rsquo; stories and their leadership journeys. Another speaker was a professional business consultant who focuses on leadership training. Alba in particular got a lot out of that speaker, because she leads a team at her work. The third speaker was the vice president of Leader Impact worldwide, he introduced to us the concept and mission of TraNet. We also had various smaller seminars throughout, on interesting topics such as the Sabbath rest as applies to business, and integrating faith and work from a former communist perspective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Continuing Resolve</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2017/02_continuing_resolve/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 19:05:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2017/02_continuing_resolve/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lots of stuff has happened this past month! Last I posted I was in the middle
of a 2-week break in Dallas. That was a great and relaxing time for me, helped
me to prepare mentally and spiritually for these next 7 months in Albania. I
saw friends and family and enjoyed plenty of tacos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got back it was right back into the swing of things with a seminar the
next day. It was a video seminar, we showed &lt;a href="http://www.willowcreek.com/events/leadership/2016-domestic-b/#faculty%23PatrickLencioni">Patrick Lencioni&amp;rsquo;s talk from the
2016 Global Leadership Summit&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
It had already been subtitled in Albanian. The talk was great, but when we
asked our partners afterwards for their feedback they said it would be better
to have a live speaker in the future. So, as much as possible, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to
do that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merry Christmas</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2016/12_merry_christmas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2016 04:56:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2016/12_merry_christmas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Merry Christmas to everybody!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love Christmas time, spending time with family, listening to the Advent messages at church, and especially the Christmas hymns. My favorite is &amp;lsquo;O Holy Night&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s my favorite because it speaks of the hope that came into the world when Jesus Christ was born. Hope is an elusive thing. Lots of people lose hope when what they desire becomes impossible, or even worse, when they get exactly what they wanted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When you eat chili 3 days in a row</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2016/11_too_much_chili/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 14:29:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2016/11_too_much_chili/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on follow up since Momentum Europe.

meetings with people, and had some good conversations. Of course our goal is
to help our partners to do that more and more - to have the conversations that
lead to Gospel presentations, to encourage them to share with and invite
more people, and to build their confidence.&lt;/p>

about 20 young professionals out to Durres for 2 days of working through the
&lt;a href="http://burstingyourbubble.org/">&amp;ldquo;Bursting Your Bubble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> curriculum. It was

first big event, Momentum Europe. I&amp;rsquo;ve been busying myself with a lot of administrative
work, but we&amp;rsquo;ve also had opportunity to begin training our committed believers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bursting-your-bubble">Bursting your Bubble&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my opinion, our greatest success last year was finding 8 believers who have decided
to commit to being part of our ministry. One of the things we asked of them is to
commit to be trained in evangelism by our staff. We started that training this month
with the series &lt;a href="http://burstingyourbubble.org/">&amp;ldquo;Bursting Your Bubble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summer Recap</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2016/08_summer_recap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2016 15:30:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2016/08_summer_recap/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy couple months!

For the first 2 days though I also have some other responsibilities. My ministry team here in Albania, Leader-Led Movements, has a 2-day evangelistic conference called Life Choices. The graciously allowed me to go do Ice and Spice instead, but I still want to help them set up and tear down. It&amp;rsquo;s also different because I won&amp;rsquo;t stay at the hotel with the team.

Like any job it&amp;rsquo;s got ups and downs. Sometimes you work real hard for what seems like minimal gain. Sometimes you have all these cool plans and they get interrupted by something out of your control. Especially when your job is people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This past week was tough for me. It started out good, I had a couple good coffees and we planned our social meeting on Wednesday. Tuesday evening we had a bible study, and that was enjoyable. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling some progress on Albanian, but it&amp;rsquo;s still tough to understand native speakers. Wednesday we had our social meeting, and we had a bunch of people come, but the two people I specifically invited did not come. So that was a bit disappointing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring and Networking</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2016/01_exploring-and-networking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2016 22:02:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2016/01_exploring-and-networking/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Sunrise over Malaga" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2016/malaga_sunrise.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This past week I went to the STINT Mid-Year conference in Málaga, Spain. It was a lot of fun to hang out with a bunch of Americans! I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anyone when I got there, but by the end I had made several friends. The beachfront was beautiful, especially the late sunrise over the Mediterranean. I was excited to play a bunch of Ultimate Frisbee, since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t played for several months.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The first 3 months</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/12_the_first_3_months/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2015 13:49:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/12_the_first_3_months/</guid><description>&lt;p>I want to spend some time in this blog post unpacking what I&amp;rsquo;ve felt, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve found here in the past almost 3 months since I came to Albania. I really can&amp;rsquo;t believe time has gone by so fast. There&amp;rsquo;s so much to do, and so many new friends that it&amp;rsquo;s never boring. Is this what I want to do with the rest of my life? I can&amp;rsquo;t answer that yet. But I have met so many people here who have devoted their lives to missions. Is it worth it to do so? They would answer unequivocally yes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome Weekend</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/12_welcome_weekend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 20:31:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/12_welcome_weekend/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-a-great-weekend">What a great weekend!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This weekend we had some visitors from Dallas. Rick Howard, the missions pastor for Watermark, and Cheryl Boyd came to visit. It was great to see them, to be encouraged by some friends from home. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to this for a while!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cheryl has been in Eastern Europe with CRU for 12+ years, and so she knew a lot of CRU staff here in Albania. She and Alma Elliot are great friends, and were super excited to see eachother. In all those years somehow she never made it to Albania, so this was a great chance for her to catch up with some of her old friends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter • Dec 1 2015</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/newsletter/01-12-2015/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/newsletter/01-12-2015/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Remaining Humble</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/11_remaining_humble/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 10:31:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/11_remaining_humble/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week we had our first young-professionals meeting! We had 17 people come to hear Dennis Beck speak on worldview. He did a great job telling stories which got the participants to think. He has a talent for conveying these high concepts in story form. The discussion went well also. I sat at a table with a few young professionals. Two of them are believers from Fabi&amp;rsquo;s church. The other was Dejvis, with whom I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a relationship. He&amp;rsquo;s the manager of the Cinnabon franchise next to the American embassy. He really enjoys coming to our seminars when he&amp;rsquo;s not working, and often brings friends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter • Nov 3 2015</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/newsletter/03-11-2015/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2015 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/newsletter/03-11-2015/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Slow Going</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/10_slow-going/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2015 14:35:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/10_slow-going/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Albania now almost 3 weeks. Prior to now, the longest I&amp;rsquo;d ever been outside the US was 10 days. It definitely feels strange, knowing I&amp;rsquo;ll be here probably 6 or 7 more months before I make a trip back to Dallas. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things I&amp;rsquo;ve been missing - including having a clothes dryer and a dishwasher. I saw some pictures of friends going to the State Fair, and I felt a bit homesick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Day 1 in Albania</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/09_day-1-in-albania/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 15:15:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/09_day-1-in-albania/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m here!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just as I remember it. All the buildings, streets, people. It almost feels like a 2nd home. I arrived at 2:30pm, and was picked up by my team leader Illir Stavro. He dropped me off at my apartment, which I&amp;rsquo;m sharing with two new members of the high-school ministry team: Gedis and Pal. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice, small apartment. I have my own room, and there&amp;rsquo;s a living area with a couch and a small bathroom and kitchen. It&amp;rsquo;s different from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to but not too different.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Newsletter • Sep 26 2015</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/newsletter/26-9-2015/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2015 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/newsletter/26-9-2015/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fully funded!</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/08_fully-funded/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 20:40:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/08_fully-funded/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to a good friend hosting an event last weekend, I have now reached my monthly goal!

&lt;p>Speaking of which, I bought my plane tickets today! First time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever bought a one-way flight. But it&amp;rsquo;s locked in now. I fly from Dallas to Washington D.C. on September 23, and I&amp;rsquo;ll fly from DC to Tirana on Sunday the 27th.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal • 2015</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2015/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2015 21:36:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2015/</guid><description>&lt;div class="data-img" style="width:100%; max-width:100%">

&lt;p>Back for a third time! Kinda hard to believe we got 20 people. We have 2 teams full of great people and we&amp;rsquo;re here and ready to rumble. Will and Lauren are leading one team of 10 that&amp;rsquo;s staying in Tirana, while Lucy and I lead the team that will depart to Elbasan on Sunday.
Getting here was much better than last year, thanks mostly to Lucy&amp;rsquo;s organizational leadership and Will&amp;rsquo;s being on the ball with prep. In fact I pretty much left most of the prep work to them. It&amp;rsquo;s great that Lucy&amp;rsquo;s leadership style is pretty much the opposite of mine. We complement eachother well even if we butt heads sometimes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Almost time</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/06_almost-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 21:38:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/archive/2015/06_almost-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>In less than 2 weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Albania :) This time just for 2 weeks, but I&amp;rsquo;m ready to go for good. But, all things in their time:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is a time for everything,&lt;br>
and a season for every activity under the heavens:&lt;br>
a time to be born and a time to die,&lt;br>
a time to plant and a time to uproot,&lt;br>
a time to kill and a time to heal,&lt;br>
a time to tear down and a time to build,&lt;br>
a time to weep and a time to laugh,&lt;br>
a time to mourn and a time to dance,&lt;br>
a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,&lt;br>
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,&lt;br>
a time to search and a time to give up,&lt;br>
a time to keep and a time to throw away,&lt;br>
a time to tear and a time to mend,&lt;br>
a time to be silent and a time to speak,&lt;br>
a time to love and a time to hate,&lt;br>
a time for war and a time for peace.&lt;br>

My name is Gordon Burgett and I&amp;rsquo;m going to Albania this summer. I first
went in the summer of 2013, and fell in love with both the people and the mission.
Since that time I’ve been back and forth every summer, and a few stints in between.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re continuing the work we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing over the past 8+ years.
As the Poland Re:Generation project matures, we&amp;rsquo;re starting to look into new ways
we can support the native staff and church members in Albania and beyond. This
is a great opportunity for us to continue to invest in people whose hearts are
fully devoted to God:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal • 2014</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2014/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2014 21:36:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2014/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="travel-days">Travel Days&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>We flew overnight on Austrian airways, leaving early morning on the 12th with a layover at Washington Dulles. We were all tired, but some of us were awake enough to go out to the National Air and Space museum Udvar-Hazy center for a couple hours. My dad decided to meet us there, since my parents live in Washington DC. He, my little sister Alina and I hung out with Will, Danita, and Ron at the museum, which was pretty awesome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journal • 2013</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2013/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2013 21:36:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2013/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Albania Fried Chicken" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/albania/2013/afc.jpg">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why God brought us down here. What more can we do that He&amp;rsquo;s not already doing? Today we got off the plane, and found out our luggage won&amp;rsquo;t arrive until tomorrow. We rode into town with a nice guy who picked us up. We were met at the hotel by Aldo, who is one of the leaders of Ice and Spice.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
