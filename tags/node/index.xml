      <description>My site is getting pretty big now! 50+ posts, plus my journal entries from years past, I have content stretching over 4 years. So I started thinking about ways to add search functionality. And anyone who knows me knows I like to make these kind of things more complicated than they need to be, so with that in mind I had a fun challenge to solve. How do I add search functionality to a static site?</description>

      <description>So I wanted an app server. How hard could it be right? Well, not really that hard at all.
I was tired of having a static site served by apache. I want to do some cool stuff with the google APIs, like maybe a form submit where the results end up in a google doc for me. To do that I need more than hugo&amp;rsquo;s static site generation. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get rid of hugo because I like a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s features, so I added nodejs on top of it as the application server.</description>
