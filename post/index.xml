&lt;p>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid
a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how
he builds upon it. For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid,
which is Jesus Christ.

&lt;p>What is it that we are building together with our partners in Albania? Why do you keep
supporting me and my team in going back, now for the 7th year in a row? Firstly
let me be clear that we are building nothing of our own, but rather we are building
on the foundation that has already been laid. CRU has already done an amazing
job of building up the Church in Albania, coming in shortly after Communism fell
armed with nothing but the Gospel. Christ through them has laid the foundation
of a small yet vibrant Church in Albania.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Acts 29</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2018/07_acts_29_in_albania/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 08:55:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2018/07_acts_29_in_albania/</guid><description>&lt;p>This month, while we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the summer project here in Albania, I&amp;rsquo;ve
been reading the book of Acts. I love all the descriptions in the book of Acts
of faithful people who were not Apostles. Some of them, like Cornelius the centurion,
had been faithful for a very long time, and God answered their prayers powefully.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in
and say to him, “Cornelius.” And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it,
Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial
before God.
&amp;hellip;
While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the
word. And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed,
because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.

for modeling various complex types. The new syntax that I wanted to play with
was the conditional type syntax,&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-ts" data-lang="ts">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">T&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">extends&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">U&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">?&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">X&lt;/span> : &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Y&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This syntax allows you to express some really crazy type relationships! Some of
the most interesting ones have been pre-defined in the Typescript standard lib:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Exclude&amp;lt;T, U&amp;gt;&lt;/code> – Exclude from T those types that are assignable to U.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>Extract&amp;lt;T, U&amp;gt;&lt;/code> – Extract from T those types that are assignable to U.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I wanted to see if I could use these to model the way we&amp;rsquo;ve been working with
return values from &lt;a href="https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/">Contentful&amp;rsquo;s Content Delivery API&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preparing for the Summer</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2018/04_upcoming_summer_project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2018 20:18:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2018/04_upcoming_summer_project/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s that time again!

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so glad that I already had a chance to get back to Albania in December,
when we put on &lt;a href="http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/12_mens_retreat/">a men&amp;rsquo;s conference for Cornerstone Church of Tirana&lt;/a>.
That was a great time of fun and fellowship with many of my close Albanian friends.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping in touch with them although it&amp;rsquo;s been difficult due to the time
difference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Men's Retreat in Albania</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/12_mens_retreat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:18:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/12_mens_retreat/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I look back on my experience with Albania, starting from &lt;a href="http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2013/">my first trip there in 2013&lt;/a>
until now, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but be amazed at the way God has used this partnership to bring
change not only in my life but in the lives of my friends. My key verse for my 2-year stint
in Albania was Mark 10:29-30&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or
mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a
hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children
and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.

It&amp;rsquo;s been a while! I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with settling in to my new job and routine with Watermark.
It&amp;rsquo;s a really great place to work and I feel super blessed to have the opportunity to join staff there!
But even as I readjust to life in America I&amp;rsquo;m still looking back to Albania and my next opportunity to
go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the Lord graciously provides! I will be going on a trip in December with Will Noll, Matt Rial,
Chris Hyland, and hopefully 1 to 2 others. We have been communicating with the elders of Guri i Themelit
church over there to set up a weekend guys&amp;rsquo; retreat, where we will discuss openness and authenticity.
They expect upwards of 50 guys to come out to this retreat!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making a static site searchable</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/07_making_a_searchable_static_site/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2017 17:28:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/07_making_a_searchable_static_site/</guid><description>&lt;p>My site is getting pretty big now! 50+ posts, plus my journal entries from years past, I have content stretching over 4 years.

&lt;p>All good things come to an end, and my STINT in Albania is no different. On 7 August I fly back to Dallas to spend at least 1 year there, with the hope that I&amp;rsquo;ll return to live in Albania sooner rather than later. At this point I&amp;rsquo;m holding all my plans loosely. I know what I want to do for the next year, but beyond that it&amp;rsquo;s up to God.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Big Decision</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/06_big_decision/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2017 19:50:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/06_big_decision/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve got an announcement to make. These past several months I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring two options for my time after my STINT is up. One area I was exploring was with the Digital Strategies team in Albania, working for Afrim Karoshi. I went to a conference with the Digital Strategies team here in May as part of that exploration. The second area was an open position at Watermark Community Church as a programmer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Leadership</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/05_digital_leadership/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2017 13:39:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/05_digital_leadership/</guid><description>&lt;p>April was a fairly slow month. We had our normal schedule of a professional meeting and a social time. This month we had fewer people than normal, but we had a lot of new people which was very interesting. I&amp;rsquo;ve had several opportunities to follow up with contacts, though this appears to be a busy time of year for most of the professionals. We are trying more to model the follow-up process for our partners, inviting them into these meetings and giving them opportunities to lead. Albert has been doing a great job helping me mentor one of the new believers in the first steps of learning about his faith.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern Static Sites</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/04_modern_static_sites/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:49:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/04_modern_static_sites/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today in 2017, there are a thousand and one different ways to build a website. As always there&amp;rsquo;s good old fashioned &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress&lt;/a>, and of course there&amp;rsquo;s drag-n-drop website builders like &lt;a href="http://www.wix.com">Wix&lt;/a>. One thing these have in common is that they need a traditional hosting environment, and for that you gotta pay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you can manage it, the cheapest way to host a website nowadays is to create a static HTML site. But don&amp;rsquo;t hand-craft HTML, that&amp;rsquo;s hard and boring. Use a static site generator, for fun and profit!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>March Project</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/04_march_project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2017 22:08:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/04_march_project/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="we-love-momentum">We love momentum&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>March 13-17 was a big week for us. We invited a group from Louisville, TX To join us for a week-long momentum building project. This group had an amazing impact, we drew in well over 100 people for the seminar, and our social time was a big success as well. We got a lot of new contacts and, as was our goal, we will be following up with them over the coming weeks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automating more work</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/03_automating_more_work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 16:20:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/03_automating_more_work/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I took a look at my blog recently to make sure everything is working, and got a big fat &amp;ldquo;Your connection is not secure&amp;rdquo; message.

&lt;p>Fortunately I just need to request a new certificate from Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt and install it. I&amp;rsquo;ve done this before, it&amp;rsquo;s a 10 minute job. Buuuuuttt&amp;hellip;
what if I could automate it? If I spend all afternoon on this I&amp;rsquo;ll save myself 15 minutes of work every 3 months! That math totally works out right?&lt;br>

This past weekend we went to Cyprus for a conference about reaching leaders and influencers for Christ. The group was about 28 people, including 10 professionals, 4 teachers, two businesswomen and a government worker. It was a great time of learning and inspiring our partners to reach their peers for Christ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Group pic" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2017/tranet_2017/group_pic.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One speaker was a bible teacher who took us through the book of Mark, highlighting the disciples&amp;rsquo; stories and their leadership journeys. Another speaker was a professional business consultant who focuses on leadership training. Alba in particular got a lot out of that speaker, because she leads a team at her work. The third speaker was the vice president of Leader Impact worldwide, he introduced to us the concept and mission of TraNet. We also had various smaller seminars throughout, on interesting topics such as the Sabbath rest as applies to business, and integrating faith and work from a former communist perspective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Continuing Resolve</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/02_continuing_resolve/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 19:05:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/02_continuing_resolve/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lots of stuff has happened this past month! Last I posted I was in the middle
of a 2-week break in Dallas. That was a great and relaxing time for me, helped
me to prepare mentally and spiritually for these next 7 months in Albania. I
saw friends and family and enjoyed plenty of tacos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got back it was right back into the swing of things with a seminar the
next day. It was a video seminar, we showed &lt;a href="http://www.willowcreek.com/events/leadership/2016-domestic-b/#faculty%23PatrickLencioni">Patrick Lencioni&amp;rsquo;s talk from the
2016 Global Leadership Summit&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
It had already been subtitled in Albanian. The talk was great, but when we
asked our partners afterwards for their feedback they said it would be better
to have a live speaker in the future. So, as much as possible, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to
do that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merry Christmas</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/12_merry_christmas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2016 04:56:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/12_merry_christmas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Merry Christmas to everybody!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love Christmas time, spending time with family, listening to the Advent messages at church, and especially the Christmas hymns. My favorite is &amp;lsquo;O Holy Night&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s my favorite because it speaks of the hope that came into the world when Jesus Christ was born. Hope is an elusive thing. Lots of people lose hope when what they desire becomes impossible, or even worse, when they get exactly what they wanted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When you eat chili 3 days in a row</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/11_too_much_chili/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 14:29:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/11_too_much_chili/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on follow up since Momentum Europe. We&amp;rsquo;ve had some good
meetings with people, and had some good conversations. Of course our goal is
to help our partners to do that more and more - to have the conversations that
lead to Gospel presentations, to encourage them to share with and invite
more people, and to build their confidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="professionals on the beach in Durres" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2016/yps_byb_1.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To that end we organized a training conference this past weekend. We invited
about 20 young professionals out to Durres for 2 days of working through the
&lt;a href="http://burstingyourbubble.org/">&amp;ldquo;Bursting Your Bubble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> curriculum. It was
a great success! They enjoyed the time together and came away with a stronger

first big event, Momentum Europe. I&amp;rsquo;ve been busying myself with a lot of administrative
work, but we&amp;rsquo;ve also had opportunity to begin training our committed believers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bursting-your-bubble">Bursting your Bubble&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my opinion, our greatest success last year was finding 8 believers who have decided
to commit to being part of our ministry. One of the things we asked of them is to
commit to be trained in evangelism by our staff. We started that training this month
with the series &lt;a href="http://burstingyourbubble.org/">&amp;ldquo;Bursting Your Bubble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taking Control of My Data</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/09_taking_control_of_my_data/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2016 15:33:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/09_taking_control_of_my_data/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my projects during my vacation has been to take back control of my data. The question of online privacy is a difficult one, because while there&amp;rsquo;s some things you can do to improve your privacy, to really own your data takes a lot of effort and learning. For most people, hosting their own services is more headache than it&amp;rsquo;s worth. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good privacy-conscious services out there if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to pay, but most people are not willing to pay. The convenience trumps the privacy concerns, and for me it has been that way for a long time as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summer Recap</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/08_summer_recap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2016 15:30:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/08_summer_recap/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy couple months! When I last posted we were about to start Ice and Spice, CRU Albania&amp;rsquo;s summer camp for high school students. As part of my role on the LLM team, I was also helping out with an International School Project conference for teachers and principals. So I was already a little worn out when Ice and Spice started! But I got energized when my friends arrived from Texas. It was a great week, filled with a lot of good conversations with high school students.

Having just spent 5 weeks there, I can totally confirm that is still the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve committed to a second year here, I felt the need to go home and ask my supporters to commit to a second year with me. This was the perfect time to do it, since my cousin was getting married on June 4.

&lt;p>We have a growing number of contacts now, young professional believers who have been joining us for seminars and other activities. We&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of vision casting meetings with them too. Word is beginning to get around that this is a place to continue what they were doing with student ministries. Most of our volunteers were formerly part of Jete Studentore (CRU&amp;rsquo;s campus ministry), which is a very good thing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shift musical</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/03_shift_musical/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2016 17:56:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/03_shift_musical/</guid><description>&lt;p>We got to see a really cool musical event this week!

&lt;p>CRU&amp;rsquo;s high school and college ministries invited a lot of students from all around Tirana. I even saw the Elbasan kids show up. Our young professionals all went and sat together near the front. It was pretty awesome to see how many people showed up!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sometimes It's Tough</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/02_sometimes_its_tough/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2016 14:35:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/02_sometimes_its_tough/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a lot about the good times recently on this blog, but I thought with this post I&amp;rsquo;d let y&amp;rsquo;all in on the tough parts. Like any job it&amp;rsquo;s got ups and downs. Sometimes you work real hard for what seems like minimal gain. Sometimes you have all these cool plans and they get interrupted by something out of your control. Especially when your job is people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This past week was tough for me. It started out good, I had a couple good coffees and we planned our social meeting on Wednesday. Tuesday evening we had a bible study, and that was enjoyable. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling some progress on Albanian, but it&amp;rsquo;s still tough to understand native speakers. Wednesday we had our social meeting, and we had a bunch of people come, but the two people I specifically invited did not come. So that was a bit disappointing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adventures in Dockerland</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/02_adventures-in-dockerland/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 20:33:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/02_adventures-in-dockerland/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a serious docker/aws kick recently. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned just enough that it drives me to play with it. I spent a lot of my free time on it this week, and didn&amp;rsquo;t spend as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like on learning Albanian&amp;hellip; This could be a problem&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways I might as well post more about what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make my web server more robust, to where if it dies for whatever reason I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything, it&amp;rsquo;ll come back on a new instance all on its own. Unfortunately that&amp;rsquo;s a bit more difficult than you&amp;rsquo;d expect.

One of my issues with using Amazon&amp;rsquo;s container service is that they make you assign resource values to each container, and those are not flexible. So, I have to give each container high enough memory that it won&amp;rsquo;t die, but then I run out of space on my server real quick. Since most of the stuff I want to host just sits idle the majority of the time, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring and Networking</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/01_exploring-and-networking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2016 22:02:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/01_exploring-and-networking/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Sunrise over Malaga" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2016/malaga_sunrise.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This past week I went to the STINT Mid-Year conference in Málaga, Spain. It was a lot of fun to hang out with a bunch of Americans! I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anyone when I got there, but by the end I had made several friends. The beachfront was beautiful, especially the late sunrise over the Mediterranean. I was excited to play a bunch of Ultimate Frisbee, since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t played for several months.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hosting Reclaimed</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/01_hosting_reclaimed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 21:31:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/01_hosting_reclaimed/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s another technical post for y&amp;rsquo;all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had some time this past weekend, so I took a look into the website I made a year ago for &lt;a href="http://www.reclaimed431.org">Reclaimed&lt;/a>. The old version was made with &lt;a href="http://locomotivecms.com/">Locomotive CMS&lt;/a>, and hosted on &lt;a href="http://www.locomotivehosting.com">Locomotive hosting&lt;/a>. It was a good choice at the time, because we needed something fast. We wanted to deploy it before the 2015 super bowl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d previously looked into moving it to Wordpress or Drupal, but that would basically require redoing the whole site. More work than I&amp;rsquo;m willing to put in. But, just this past weekend, &lt;a href="http://locomotive.works/">Locomotive v3&lt;/a> came out. I decided to try hosting it myself, because $20/mo is just a bit too much to be paying for a simple website like this. Plus, it would be fun! (or so I thought.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The first 3 months</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2015/12_the_first_3_months/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2015 13:49:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2015/12_the_first_3_months/</guid><description>&lt;p>I want to spend some time in this blog post unpacking what I&amp;rsquo;ve felt, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve found here in the past almost 3 months since I came to Albania. I really can&amp;rsquo;t believe time has gone by so fast. There&amp;rsquo;s so much to do, and so many new friends that it&amp;rsquo;s never boring. Is this what I want to do with the rest of my life? I can&amp;rsquo;t answer that yet. But I have met so many people here who have devoted their lives to missions. Is it worth it to do so?

&lt;p>This weekend we had some visitors from Dallas. Rick Howard, the missions pastor for Watermark, and Cheryl Boyd came to visit. It was great to see them, to be encouraged by some friends from home. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to this for a while!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cheryl has been in Eastern Europe with CRU for 12+ years, and so she knew a lot of CRU staff here in Albania. She and Alma Elliot are great friends, and were super excited to see eachother. In all those years somehow she never made it to Albania, so this was a great chance for her to catch up with some of her old friends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remaining Humble</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2015/11_remaining_humble/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 10:31:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2015/11_remaining_humble/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week we had our first young-professionals meeting! We had 17 people come to hear Dennis Beck speak on worldview. He did a great job telling stories which got the participants to think. He has a talent for conveying these high concepts in story form. The discussion went well also. I sat at a table with a few young professionals. Two of them are believers from Fabi&amp;rsquo;s church. The other was Dejvis, with whom I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a relationship. He&amp;rsquo;s the manager of the Cinnabon franchise next to the American embassy.

Prior to now, the longest I&amp;rsquo;d ever been outside the US was 10 days. It definitely feels strange, knowing I&amp;rsquo;ll be here probably 6 or 7 more months before I make a trip back to Dallas. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things I&amp;rsquo;ve been missing - including having a clothes dryer and a dishwasher. I saw some pictures of friends going to the State Fair, and I felt a bit homesick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running with Docker</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2015/10_running_with_docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2015 20:33:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2015/10_running_with_docker/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="locked-out">Locked out!&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just as I remember it. All the buildings, streets, people. It almost feels like a 2nd home. I arrived at 2:30pm, and was picked up by my team leader Illir Stavro. He dropped me off at my apartment, which I&amp;rsquo;m sharing with two new members of the high-school ministry team: Gedis and Pal. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice, small apartment. I have my own room, and there&amp;rsquo;s a living area with a couch and a small bathroom and kitchen.

a time to tear down and a time to build,&lt;br>
a time to weep and a time to laugh,&lt;br>
a time to mourn and a time to dance,&lt;br>
a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,&lt;br>
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,&lt;br>
a time to search and a time to give up,&lt;br>
a time to keep and a time to throw away,&lt;br>
a time to tear and a time to mend,&lt;br>
a time to be silent and a time to speak,&lt;br>
a time to love and a time to hate,&lt;br>
a time for war and a time for peace.&lt;br>

What is love? Is it just not hurting me, as the song goes?

&lt;p>The scripture has a different definition of love.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. &lt;span class="red">You are My friends if you do what I command you.&lt;/span> No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you. This I command you, that you love one another.&lt;br>

&lt;p>That worked for me for a while, until I needed to update the version of ruby I&amp;rsquo;m using.
