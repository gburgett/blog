# Day 1
<h2 id="Jul-2" class="hidden-xs">Sunday July 1</h2>

We traveled overnight Friday, finally arriving Saturday night.  After checking into the hotel I was beat.  I went to sleep right away and managed to sleep 9 hours straight.  It was good though to see Berti, Pal, Ueda, and Aldo, who all picked us up at the airport.

Berti invited me to his bible study group before church.  I met up with them at 8am at Mon Cheri.  Berti, Xhulio, Zamir, Visi, and Landi have been meeting regularly to study the Bible.  They were talking about Psalm 58 this week, and we discussed the contrast between "The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;" (v10) and Jesus' words: "Love your enemies and proy for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44).  I'm glad to see those guys getting together to dig into God's word!

From there we went to Church at 10 am.  I spent some time saying hi to as many people as I could find!  It's great to be back, it almost feels like coming home.  It's been a while since I've been able to sing worship songs in Albanian, though I have once or twice played some Albanian worship off of YouTube back in Dallas.

The sermon was on Acts 15.  Gusti Prenga did a great job talking about the freedom we have in the Gospel.  His opening hook was a play on the name of Lionel Messi, who had just lost in the knockout stage of the World Cup.  He said, "A eshte Mesia mjaft?" - Is the Messiah enough?  For Argentina it seems the answer was No.

But for us the answer is Yes.  The context is that some former pharisees were arguing that believers need to be circumcised, and so to adopt the entire law of Moses.  But in verse 28 the leadership decided "not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements...".  The law is a burden.  But we have freedom from that burden.  Christ took the burden that we cannot bear.

One point was particularly insightful.  He said that of all the groups in the world, we Christians have to be the most flexible with cultural differences.  Too often we confuse our culture, our way of doing things, with the Gospel.  We have to be careful to not place an undue burden on others.

Lunch after church was pretty good too, I got to sit next to Egli.  He's about to move to Portugal for a job.  I'm hoping to get some coffee with him this week or next to help him prepare spiritually.  He just got baptized with the Church on June 10!  I'm glad for him.

We went out with Gesi Qiriazi afterwards to watch the World Cup.  We had a great time just chilling at this new coffee bar.  He said that the owner wants to plant a church as well, and use the coffee bar to support his ministry.  I'll happily keep buying drinks there, it's a great location with a beautiful outdoor section.  They also have Oreo shakes.  I didn't get one but I wanted to.  Instead I had my first Fanta Exotic of the trip.

We had dinner at Era, just the American team.  We discussed the schedule for the week just a little bit, but mostly we just hung out with Lauren, whom we haven't seen in a good while!  It was definitely fun catching up with her.  We've been taking it easy this first day, which I think was the right decision.  Some of us had to work extra before we left just to take this time off to come here.  Tomorrow we'll hit the ground running.  Mark already has messaged a couple guys for coffee, and it seems that Bela & the Sotmeria girls are working on setting up coffees for the ladies.
