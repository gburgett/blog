We've been working on follow up since Momentum Europe.  We've had some good
meetings with people, and had some good conversations.  Of course our goal is
to help our partners to do that more and more - to have the conversations that
lead to Gospel presentations, to encourage them to share with and invite
more people, and to build their confidence.

To that end we organized a training conference this past weekend.  We invited
about 20 young professionals out to Durres for 2 days of working through the
["Bursting Your Bubble"](http://burstingyourbubble.org/) curriculum.  It was
a great success!  They enjoyed the time together and came away with a stronger
desire to serve and share with their peers.

Unfortunately I couldn't go.  Saturday morning I woke up vomiting.  I couldn't
eat or drink anything until Sunday.  My roommates Pal and Eriol ended up taking
me to the hospital, where I got an IV and a few prescription pills.  By mid-day
Sunday I felt much better, but by then it was too late to join the group in Durres.
It was probably the chili that I made on Wednesday, and ate for dinner also
Thursday and Friday.  But my roommates also ate it and didn't get sick, so I'm
not really sure what it was.

It really sucked to not be able to go there.  I was really excited to join them
for the training and see how God was working.  I wanted to share with them some
things I had been learning too, and to encourage them during this time.  This is
probably one of the most important things we'll do all year.  I was really
disappointed that I couldn't go.

At the same time, I think God knew that it would be better for my sake to stay
home.  As I look back, the theme of this past year could be summed up as "boasting
in my weakness."  God doesn't need me to inspire the young professionals.  In fact,
anything I can do is only temporary.  God is the one who has to give them a vision
for how He wants to impact Albania.  If I want to see God change young professionals
here, the best thing I can do is pray.  So I did - I spent Saturday evening
praying for them by name.

God is in control - even to the point of making me sick if He needs to.  He's
the one who's going to change the hearts of believers and non-believers here.
Please join me in boasting in the weakness of our staff, and seeing God move
in spite of us.
