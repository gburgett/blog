All the buildings, streets, people. It almost feels like a 2nd home. I arrived at 2:30pm, and was picked up by my team leader Illir Stavro. He dropped me off at my apartment, which I&rsquo;m sharing with two new members of the high-school ministry team: Gedis and Pal. It&rsquo;s a nice, small apartment. I have my own room, and there&rsquo;s a living area with a couch and a small bathroom and kitchen. It&rsquo;s different from what I&rsquo;m used to but not too different.</p><p>Gedis and I had dinner with Aldo and Blerina. It was great to see them again! I&rsquo;m excited to be able to keep hanging out with them over the course of the next year. Amanda is so big now! She&rsquo;s walking and talking, even some English. Aldo apparently talks to her in English at home.</p><p>We went home and I unpacked, then got ready for bed because I want to join the team meeting tomorrow morning. As I was sitting there in my new bed, a wave of feelings came over me. I miss my friends, my house, my church, my (well, really Matt&rsquo;s) couch. The weight of not being able to go back to Dallas for a year finally hit me. I opened up my Bible and read a bit. I&rsquo;m a bit behind in Join the Journey, so I was reading Haggai 1. The Israelites had returned from their Babylonian exile, and instead of building up God&rsquo;s temple they were investing in their own houses, their own comforts and riches.</p><blockquote><p>This is what the LORD Almighty says:<br>&lsquo;These people say, &ldquo;The time has not yet come
to rebuild the LORD&rsquo;s house&rdquo;&rsquo;<br>Then the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai:<br>&lsquo;Is it a time for you yourselves to be living
in your paneled houses, while this house remains a ruin?&rsquo;
<span class=source><a href=http://biblehub.com/niv/haggai/1.htm>Haggai 1:2-4</a></span></p></blockquote><p>In our time, the LORD&rsquo;s house is the body of believers. He is building something here in Albania. So is it a time for me to be living in my &ldquo;paneled house&rdquo; in dallas? Or is it a time for me to be building the LORD&rsquo;s house in Albania?</p><p>God came through for me tonight. He gave me a peace with this decision, and an understanding that He is in this effort. I&rsquo;m sure there will be more hard times ahead, when all I want is to go home to my familiar and comfortable environment. But God is with me, and that&rsquo;s all I need. Please pray with me that God would sustain me, and that He would bless our efforts.</p></div></div></div></body><link rel=stylesheet href=/js/highlight/styles/vs2015.css><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/main.min.js></script><script src=/js/custom.js></script><script src=/js/highlight/highlight.pack.js></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()</script></html>
