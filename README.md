## Gordon Burgett's personal blog

This repo contains my personal blog.  It's mostly a static web site, but it's hosted by nodejs using express.

All the static files are generated by Hugo.  These files end up in the "public" directory, including the nodejs files.
This directory is the deployment package.

The server is run by executing "node node/server.js {port}" in the "public/" directory.
