      <description>Day 1 Saturday July 2 After an 11 hour overnight flight, a 7 hour layover, and multiple last-minute passport issues, we made it! As it turned out, two of our team members were unable to get their passports or travel documents in time for the flight. But the Lord is sovereign over that too, and He has a reason for everything He does. We are thankful that He allowed 10 of us to get over here!</description>

      <description>This year we unfortunately had to cancel our summer project due to COVID-19. But there&amp;rsquo;s a purpose in everything God does! Though we were sad to not see our friends during the summer, we have kept in touch with them through a weekly Zoom call. Through this weekly touchpoint, and God&amp;rsquo;s provision, we were able to go as a small team in October!
Day 1 Monday October 12 My Fiancee Allye Foster and I traveled first, arriving Monday October 12 to participate in the high school ministry&amp;rsquo;s project.</description>

      <description>The in-between I had a full week in between the Shkoder project and the YP project. I spent half of it working remote and the rest just catching up with friends. I found a really good coffee shop to work from. with a wonderful view.
Day 1 Sunday July 7 Today my first responsibility was going to get everyone from the airport. Back on the receiving end! I enjoy hosting and it was fun to be able to welcome everyone and get them settled in.</description>

      <description>Day 1 Tuesday June 25 We arrived in Tirana around noon and met Pal at the airport. Glad to be back in country! It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I was here last - too long. We went with Pal to pick up Wes and Daniel at Hotel Sokrat. While there we met with Aldo for a bit. It was nice to catch up with him too! He&amp;rsquo;s tranisitioning to a new role with partnerships, and Pal &amp;amp; Ueda next year will be taking over for him as leader of the Tirana high school ministry.</description>

      <description>Day 1 Sunday July 1 We traveled overnight Friday, finally arriving Saturday night. After checking into the hotel I was beat. I went to sleep right away and managed to sleep 9 hours straight. It was good though to see Berti, Pal, Ueda, and Aldo, who all picked us up at the airport.
Berti invited me to his bible study group before church. I met up with them at 8am at Mon Cheri.</description>

I got to go to church and have a nice afternoon coffee with a friend. We went to go pick up the group at the airport at 5:00, but the plane was delayed a bit. We had a good coffee at the airport waiting for them.</description>

      <description>photo by Ron Acord Day 1 Monday June 27 This year things have been a bit different, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying as much as possible to feel like I&amp;rsquo;m part of the American group. For the first 2 days though I also have some other responsibilities. My ministry team here in Albania, Leader-Led Movements, has a 2-day evangelistic conference called Life Choices. The graciously allowed me to go do Ice and Spice instead, but I still want to help them set up and tear down.</description>

      <description>Day 1 Monday July 4 Today was a nice break. We canceled the morning trip to Kruja, because all the Americans (including me) were worn out from the high schoolers. I slept in till about 9:30, then camped out with Wes and Chris at Mulliri Vjeter. They had to finish working on last minute changes to their presentations. We met up with the staff team for a relaxing lunch. The American team and staff got introduced to each-other and we had a nice relaxing time.</description>

      <description>photo by Ron Acord Day 1 Thursday July 2 Back for a third time! Kinda hard to believe we got 20 people. We have 2 teams full of great people and we&amp;rsquo;re here and ready to rumble. Will and Lauren are leading one team of 10 that&amp;rsquo;s staying in Tirana, while Lucy and I lead the team that will depart to Elbasan on Sunday. Getting here was much better than last year, thanks mostly to Lucy&amp;rsquo;s organizational leadership and Will&amp;rsquo;s being on the ball with prep.</description>

      <description>Travel Days July 12-13 We flew overnight on Austrian airways, leaving early morning on the 12th with a layover at Washington Dulles. We were all tired, but some of us were awake enough to go out to the National Air and Space museum Udvar-Hazy center for a couple hours. My dad decided to meet us there, since my parents live in Washington DC. He, my little sister Alina and I hung out with Will, Danita, and Ron at the museum, which was pretty awesome.</description>

      <description>Day 1 Thursday July 18 I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why God brought us down here. What more can we do that He&amp;rsquo;s not already doing? Today we got off the plane, and found out our luggage won&amp;rsquo;t arrive until tomorrow. We rode into town with a nice guy who picked us up. We were met at the hotel by Aldo, who is one of the leaders of Ice and Spice.</description>
