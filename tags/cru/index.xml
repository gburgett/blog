&lt;p>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid
a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how
he builds upon it. For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid,
which is Jesus Christ.

&lt;p>What is it that we are building together with our partners in Albania? Why do you keep
supporting me and my team in going back, now for the 7th year in a row? Firstly
let me be clear that we are building nothing of our own, but rather we are building
on the foundation that has already been laid. CRU has already done an amazing
job of building up the Church in Albania, coming in shortly after Communism fell
armed with nothing but the Gospel. Christ through them has laid the foundation
of a small yet vibrant Church in Albania.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Acts 29</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2018/07_acts_29_in_albania/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 08:55:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2018/07_acts_29_in_albania/</guid><description>&lt;p>This month, while we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the summer project here in Albania, I&amp;rsquo;ve
been reading the book of Acts. I love all the descriptions in the book of Acts
of faithful people who were not Apostles. Some of them, like Cornelius the centurion,
had been faithful for a very long time, and God answered their prayers powefully.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in
and say to him, “Cornelius.” And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it,
Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial
before God.
&amp;hellip;
While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the
word. And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed,
because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.

&lt;h1 id="looking-forward-to-going-back">Looking forward to going back&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so glad that I already had a chance to get back to Albania in December,
when we put on &lt;a href="http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2017/12_mens_retreat/">a men&amp;rsquo;s conference for Cornerstone Church of Tirana&lt;/a>.
That was a great time of fun and fellowship with many of my close Albanian friends.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping in touch with them although it&amp;rsquo;s been difficult due to the time
difference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Men's Retreat in Albania</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/12_mens_retreat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 20:18:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/12_mens_retreat/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I look back on my experience with Albania, starting from &lt;a href="http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2013/">my first trip there in 2013&lt;/a>
until now, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but be amazed at the way God has used this partnership to bring
change not only in my life but in the lives of my friends. My key verse for my 2-year stint
in Albania was Mark 10:29-30&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or
mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a
hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children
and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.

It&amp;rsquo;s been a while! I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with settling in to my new job and routine with Watermark.
It&amp;rsquo;s a really great place to work and I feel super blessed to have the opportunity to join staff there!
But even as I readjust to life in America I&amp;rsquo;m still looking back to Albania and my next opportunity to
go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the Lord graciously provides! I will be going on a trip in December with Will Noll, Matt Rial,
Chris Hyland, and hopefully 1 to 2 others. We have been communicating with the elders of Guri i Themelit
church over there to set up a weekend guys&amp;rsquo; retreat, where we will discuss openness and authenticity.
They expect upwards of 50 guys to come out to this retreat!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Home</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/07_home/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 11:38:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/07_home/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2017/">My journal for the 2017 project is up!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All good things come to an end, and my STINT in Albania is no different. On 7 August I fly back to Dallas to spend at least 1 year there, with the hope that I&amp;rsquo;ll return to live in Albania sooner rather than later. At this point I&amp;rsquo;m holding all my plans loosely. I know what I want to do for the next year, but beyond that it&amp;rsquo;s up to God.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Big Decision</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/06_big_decision/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2017 19:50:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/06_big_decision/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve got an announcement to make. These past several months I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring two options for my time after my STINT is up. One area I was exploring was with the Digital Strategies team in Albania, working for Afrim Karoshi. I went to a conference with the Digital Strategies team here in May as part of that exploration. The second area was an open position at Watermark Community Church as a programmer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Leadership</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/05_digital_leadership/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2017 13:39:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/05_digital_leadership/</guid><description>&lt;p>April was a fairly slow month. We had our normal schedule of a professional meeting and a social time. This month we had fewer people than normal, but we had a lot of new people which was very interesting. I&amp;rsquo;ve had several opportunities to follow up with contacts, though this appears to be a busy time of year for most of the professionals. We are trying more to model the follow-up process for our partners, inviting them into these meetings and giving them opportunities to lead. Albert has been doing a great job helping me mentor one of the new believers in the first steps of learning about his faith.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>March Project</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/04_march_project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2017 22:08:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/04_march_project/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="we-love-momentum">We love momentum&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>March 13-17 was a big week for us. We invited a group from Louisville, TX To join us for a week-long momentum building project. This group had an amazing impact, we drew in well over 100 people for the seminar, and our social time was a big success as well. We got a lot of new contacts and, as was our goal, we will be following up with them over the coming weeks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TraNet 2017</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/03_tranet_2017/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2017 14:36:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/03_tranet_2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>What a great weekend! This past weekend we went to Cyprus for a conference about reaching leaders and influencers for Christ. The group was about 28 people, including 10 professionals, 4 teachers, two businesswomen and a government worker. It was a great time of learning and inspiring our partners to reach their peers for Christ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Group pic" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2017/tranet_2017/group_pic.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One speaker was a bible teacher who took us through the book of Mark, highlighting the disciples&amp;rsquo; stories and their leadership journeys. Another speaker was a professional business consultant who focuses on leadership training. Alba in particular got a lot out of that speaker, because she leads a team at her work. The third speaker was the vice president of Leader Impact worldwide, he introduced to us the concept and mission of TraNet. We also had various smaller seminars throughout, on interesting topics such as the Sabbath rest as applies to business, and integrating faith and work from a former communist perspective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Continuing Resolve</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/02_continuing_resolve/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 19:05:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2017/02_continuing_resolve/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lots of stuff has happened this past month! Last I posted I was in the middle
of a 2-week break in Dallas. That was a great and relaxing time for me, helped
me to prepare mentally and spiritually for these next 7 months in Albania. I
saw friends and family and enjoyed plenty of tacos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got back it was right back into the swing of things with a seminar the
next day. It was a video seminar, we showed &lt;a href="http://www.willowcreek.com/events/leadership/2016-domestic-b/#faculty%23PatrickLencioni">Patrick Lencioni&amp;rsquo;s talk from the
2016 Global Leadership Summit&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
It had already been subtitled in Albanian. The talk was great, but when we
asked our partners afterwards for their feedback they said it would be better
to have a live speaker in the future. So, as much as possible, we&amp;rsquo;ll try to
do that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merry Christmas</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/12_merry_christmas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2016 04:56:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/12_merry_christmas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Merry Christmas to everybody!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love Christmas time, spending time with family, listening to the Advent messages at church, and especially the Christmas hymns. My favorite is &amp;lsquo;O Holy Night&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s my favorite because it speaks of the hope that came into the world when Jesus Christ was born. Hope is an elusive thing. Lots of people lose hope when what they desire becomes impossible, or even worse, when they get exactly what they wanted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When you eat chili 3 days in a row</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/11_too_much_chili/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 14:29:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/11_too_much_chili/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on follow up since Momentum Europe. We&amp;rsquo;ve had some good
meetings with people, and had some good conversations. Of course our goal is
to help our partners to do that more and more - to have the conversations that
lead to Gospel presentations, to encourage them to share with and invite
more people, and to build their confidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="professionals on the beach in Durres" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2016/yps_byb_1.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To that end we organized a training conference this past weekend. We invited
about 20 young professionals out to Durres for 2 days of working through the
&lt;a href="http://burstingyourbubble.org/">&amp;ldquo;Bursting Your Bubble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> curriculum. It was
a great success! They enjoyed the time together and came away with a stronger
desire to serve and share with their peers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Momentum Europe</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/10_momentum_europe/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Oct 2016 23:06:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/10_momentum_europe/</guid><description>&lt;p>September and October have been pretty slow months, as we plan and gear up for our
first big event, Momentum Europe. I&amp;rsquo;ve been busying myself with a lot of administrative
work, but we&amp;rsquo;ve also had opportunity to begin training our committed believers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bursting-your-bubble">Bursting your Bubble&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my opinion, our greatest success last year was finding 8 believers who have decided
to commit to being part of our ministry. One of the things we asked of them is to
commit to be trained in evangelism by our staff. We started that training this month
with the series &lt;a href="http://burstingyourbubble.org/">&amp;ldquo;Bursting Your Bubble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summer Recap</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/08_summer_recap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2016 15:30:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/08_summer_recap/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy couple months! When I last posted we were about to start Ice and Spice, CRU Albania&amp;rsquo;s summer camp for high school students. As part of my role on the LLM team, I was also helping out with an International School Project conference for teachers and principals. So I was already a little worn out when Ice and Spice started! But I got energized when my friends arrived from Texas. It was a great week, filled with a lot of good conversations with high school students. And as the Albanian team followed up with the students after my friends left, we heard several times about students who received christ!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It's Summertime!</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/06_its_summer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2016 14:33:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/06_its_summer/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="what-time-is-it-its-summertime">What time is it?

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s about time for Ice and Spice, the annual summer camp for high school students here in Tirana! My friends and I have been helping with this camp since the first time I came to Tirana, way back &lt;a href="http://www.gordonburgett.net/albania/2013/">in 2013&lt;/a>. A lot has changed since then!

I&amp;rsquo;ve had multiple definitions of &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; over the years, but right now the place I most identify as &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; is Dallas. Having just spent 5 weeks there, I can totally confirm that is still the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve committed to a second year here, I felt the need to go home and ask my supporters to commit to a second year with me. This was the perfect time to do it, since my cousin was getting married on June 4. The only other opportunity I might have would be in August, and who really wants to go to Dallas in August?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Happy Place</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/05_my_happy_place/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2016 11:59:12 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2016/05_my_happy_place/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="this-is-my-happy-place">This is my happy place&lt;/h3>

Sometimes you have all these cool plans and they get interrupted by something out of your control. Especially when your job is people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This past week was tough for me. It started out good, I had a couple good coffees and we planned our social meeting on Wednesday. Tuesday evening we had a bible study, and that was enjoyable. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling some progress on Albanian, but it&amp;rsquo;s still tough to understand native speakers. Wednesday we had our social meeting, and we had a bunch of people come, but the two people I specifically invited did not come.

&lt;p>Cheryl has been in Eastern Europe with CRU for 12+ years, and so she knew a lot of CRU staff here in Albania. She and Alma Elliot are great friends, and were super excited to see eachother.

The discussion went well also. I sat at a table with a few young professionals. Two of them are believers from Fabi&amp;rsquo;s church. The other was Dejvis, with whom I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a relationship. He&amp;rsquo;s the manager of the Cinnabon franchise next to the American embassy. He really enjoys coming to our seminars when he&amp;rsquo;s not working, and often brings friends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Slow Going</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/10_slow-going/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2015 14:35:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/10_slow-going/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Albania now almost 3 weeks. Prior to now, the longest I&amp;rsquo;d ever been outside the US was 10 days. It definitely feels strange, knowing I&amp;rsquo;ll be here probably 6 or 7 more months before I make a trip back to Dallas. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things I&amp;rsquo;ve been missing - including having a clothes dryer and a dishwasher. I saw some pictures of friends going to the State Fair, and I felt a bit homesick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Day 1 in Albania</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/09_day-1-in-albania/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 15:15:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/09_day-1-in-albania/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m here!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just as I remember it. All the buildings, streets, people. It almost feels like a 2nd home. I arrived at 2:30pm, and was picked up by my team leader Illir Stavro. He dropped me off at my apartment, which I&amp;rsquo;m sharing with two new members of the high-school ministry team: Gedis and Pal. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice, small apartment. I have my own room, and there&amp;rsquo;s a living area with a couch and a small bathroom and kitchen. It&amp;rsquo;s different from what I&amp;rsquo;m used to but not too different.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fully funded!</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/08_fully-funded/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 20:40:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/08_fully-funded/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to a good friend hosting an event last weekend, I have now reached my monthly goal!

&lt;p>Speaking of which, I bought my plane tickets today! First time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever bought a one-way flight. But it&amp;rsquo;s locked in now. I fly from Dallas to Washington D.C. on September 23, and I&amp;rsquo;ll fly from DC to Tirana on Sunday the 27th.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Almost time</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/06_almost-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 21:38:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/06_almost-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>In less than 2 weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Albania :) This time just for 2 weeks, but I&amp;rsquo;m ready to go for good.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is a time for everything,&lt;br>
and a season for every activity under the heavens:&lt;br>
a time to be born and a time to die,&lt;br>
a time to plant and a time to uproot,&lt;br>
a time to kill and a time to heal,&lt;br>
a time to tear down and a time to build,&lt;br>
a time to weep and a time to laugh,&lt;br>
a time to mourn and a time to dance,&lt;br>
a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,&lt;br>
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,&lt;br>
a time to search and a time to give up,&lt;br>
a time to keep and a time to throw away,&lt;br>
a time to tear and a time to mend,&lt;br>
a time to be silent and a time to speak,&lt;br>
a time to love and a time to hate,&lt;br>
a time for war and a time for peace.&lt;br>

My name is Gordon Burgett and I&amp;rsquo;m going to Albania this summer. I first
went in the summer of 2013, and fell in love with both the people and the mission.
Since that time I’ve been back and forth every summer, and a few stints in between.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re continuing the work we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing over the past 8+ years.
As the Poland Re:Generation project matures, we&amp;rsquo;re starting to look into new ways
we can support the native staff and church members in Albania and beyond. This
is a great opportunity for us to continue to invest in people whose hearts are
fully devoted to God:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Euro Trip!</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/01_euro-trip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 10:20:47 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/posts/2015/01_euro-trip/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Budapest Parliament" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2015/euro2015/parliament_night.jpg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best part is it&amp;rsquo;s only half over! I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post from the home of my good friend Aldo Rustemi, in Tirana the capital city of Albania. So much has happened, and so much more is to come. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wien-österreich">Wien, Österreich&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We began the trip in Vienna, where we went sightseeing just the three of us (me, Lucy and Chris). Vienna in the winter is amazing, especially when there&amp;rsquo;s snow on the ground.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
