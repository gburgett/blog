      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s another technical post for y&amp;rsquo;all!
I had some time this past weekend, so I took a look into the website I made a year ago for Reclaimed. The old version was made with Locomotive CMS, and hosted on Locomotive hosting. It was a good choice at the time, because we needed something fast. We wanted to deploy it before the 2015 super bowl.
I&amp;rsquo;d previously looked into moving it to Wordpress or Drupal, but that would basically require redoing the whole site.</description>
