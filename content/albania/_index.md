# My STINT is over!

Wow, it's already been 2 years?  Crazy!  It's been a great adventure though.  Feel free to [read all my posts from 2015 to 2017](/post/), starting with ["Day 1 in Albania"](/post/2015/09_day-1-in-albania/) and ending with ["Home"](/post/2017/07_home/).  It's been quite a journey!

If you're still supporting me, please do switch your support!  I will not need support again until next summer when I go back for the summer project with the team from Watermark.  Here's some great options for you to consider transferring your support to:

## Give to the ministry directly

The **professionals ministry** in Albania needs to raise $250/monthly to meet their budget.  If you want to continue supporting the work I have been doing, please transfer your monthly pledge to supporting directly the ministry!

The **Digital Strategies ministry** also needs fundraising to pay for website hosting, and for development of new projects.  These projects will have a huge impact not only reaching out to people through the digital medium, but also in assisting the other minstries to be more effective.  If you'd like to support the work I'll be doing in my spare time from Dallas, please transfer your monthly pledge to this account!

## Give to one of my close friends

**Eriol Petro** has been my roommate and one of my closest friends for this past year.  He's just recently decided to join staff to pursue his passion of working with students!  I'm really excited for him, he's done a great job with the student ministry as a volunteer and is definitely one of the future leaders of Cornerstone Church.  He will be full-time in Elbasan starting in September.

**Pal Hila** has been my roommate for 2 years and is another of my closest friends.  He works with the high school ministry here in Tirana and is running the show for the summer project, the same one that the group from Watermark has participated in since 2013.  He'll likely be getting married soon, and it would be great to give them a boost in support as they start doing ministry together!

**Gedis Manko** was my roommate the first year, until he got married to Çeljeta last summer.  Now he and Çeli are working at the second-largest campus in Tirana, in the neighborhood called 21-Dhjetori.  He's also one of the key leaders of Cornerstone church's new church plant in that area, along with Gentjan Doçaj.  He's another very close friend here in Albania who'se doing great work with CRU.

# What am I doing now?

As of September 1, 2017 I will be working full time for Watermark Community Church in Dallas, TX!  I'm excited about this opportunity to reconnect with my home church in Dallas, and to help them to upgrade their technology.  I'll also be working 6-10 hrs a week as a volunteer for CRU Albania's digital team.  [Check out some of the projects that we'll be working on!](http://crualbaniadigital.gitlab.io)

# Why Albania?

Albania has been on my heart since 2013 when [me, Jeff Welskopf, and Will Noll went for 10 days to evangelize high school students](/albania/2013/).  Since then our partnership with Albania has continued to grow.  In 2015 I quit my job as a programmer to spend 2 years there helping them start a ministry to professionals, similar to what we do at [The Porch in Dallas](http://www.theporchdallas.com).  In July 2017 Watermark sent 32 professionals to Albania to serve with 4 separate CRU ministries for 9 days, [including the now 2-year old Albanian professionals ministry](/albania/2017/).  This is far from the culmination of our efforts.  I expect our partnership to continue to grow over the coming years.

## The work being done in Albania is transforming the region.

The Albanians believe that the opportunity has been given to them to reach the surrounding Balkan muslim countries for Christ.  They are uniquely positioned to be welcomed into closed or unfriendly countries like Macedonia, Turkey, and Montenegro.  They take this opportunity seriously; they are constantly sending people on short term trips around the whole region, and are even sending some staff members on longer missions.

The Albanians are also hungry for the Gospel.  Having lived under Communist rule for so long, they are looking for the Truth that gives life purpose.  I’m always surprised by the number of people that are coming to CRU to hear the Gospel, and the speed with which the Albanian church is growing.

## Jesus Christ rose from the dead.

At Easter we celebrate a historical fact.  The fact that changes everything.  If Jesus Christ rose from the dead, then I too will rise from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:22), and this world is not my home (Hebrews 11:13-16).  What then in this life is not worth giving up for the sake of eternity?  Everything pales in comparison to the Resurrection.  

Secondly, if Jesus Christ rose from the dead, that validates what He said about Himself.  He is the Way the Truth and the Life, and no one comes to the Father except through Him (John 14:6).  There are people in the world today who have never heard why we celebrate Easter.  These people don’t know that God has made a way for them to be reconciled to Him, to be forgiven, redeemed and made righteous.  They have to know, and we have to go tell them! (Romans 10:13-15)  

> and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.  [1 Corinthians 15:17-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15)
