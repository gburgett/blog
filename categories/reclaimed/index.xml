&lt;p>I had some time this past weekend, so I took a look into the website I made a year ago for &lt;a href="http://www.reclaimed431.org">Reclaimed&lt;/a>. The old version was made with &lt;a href="http://locomotivecms.com/">Locomotive CMS&lt;/a>, and hosted on &lt;a href="http://www.locomotivehosting.com">Locomotive hosting&lt;/a>. It was a good choice at the time, because we needed something fast. We wanted to deploy it before the 2015 super bowl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d previously looked into moving it to Wordpress or Drupal, but that would basically require redoing the whole site. More work than I&amp;rsquo;m willing to put in. But, just this past weekend, &lt;a href="http://locomotive.works/">Locomotive v3&lt;/a> came out. I decided to try hosting it myself, because $20/mo is just a bit too much to be paying for a simple website like this. Plus, it would be fun! (or so I thought.)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
