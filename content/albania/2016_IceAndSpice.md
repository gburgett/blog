Hi there! We're about to start the 2016 Ice and Spice camp, on June 27!  It's going to be an exciting time.  Check back in July to read the whole journal!

# Day 1
<h2 id="Jun-27" class="hidden-xs">Monday June 27</h2>

This year things have been a bit different, but I'm trying as much as possible to feel like I'm part of the American group.  For the first 2 days though I also have some other responsibilities.  My ministry team here in Albania, Leader-Led Movements, has a 2-day evangelistic conference called Life Choices.  The graciously allowed me to go do Ice and Spice instead, but I still want to help them set up and tear down.  It's also different because I won't stay at the hotel with the team.  So this morning I didn't see them until we all met at the office for orientation.

Orientation went well!  I always enjoy an opportunity to worship in English.  Aldo went through the standard intro, which I've now seen 4 times.  I made a map of all the good coffee spots too, so the team doesn't always end up taking the students to the same coffee shop.  We headed over to Big Bite for lunch, which is kind of tradition now.  Matt brought out his candy: gobstoppers, nerds and laffy taffy.  He spent the whole lunch reading off laffy taffy jokes, and generally being a goofball.  Definitely had us cracking up.

We hung out around the coffee shop next to the office until about 4.  That's when the kids started to arrive.  We had about 50 the first day, many already are believers.  The first couple days will be more get-to-know-you activities.  We all got on stage as the American team and introduced ourselves one by one.  After the intro session we had several games.  Matt and I were on the same team for one, we had to fish some candy out of a bowl of flour using just our mouths!  For another we had to pass an egg along from one person to another, holding it only by a plastic spoon between our teeth.  The kids loved the games but we didn't get too much interaction from them.  Afterwards we all went to coffee and watched the big Euro Cup match of the day, Italy vs Spain.  The boys were all super interested in that.  I did talk with a couple of them about sports.  I tried to show them a bit about baseball but they weren't too interested.  At halftime the kids mostly went home.

We went after that to share fliers and invite more kids.  It can be tough to tell who are the high schoolers.  A lot of people told us no.  Some said they had been before, which I guess is a good sign.  It seems that this will be a bit of a slower year.  This is the first time we've come to open up the camp.  In the past we came for the end when things were already in full swing.  We will be doing a lot of planting this year, and discipleship with the college students who came to help.  We finished the night with a good dinner at Sass cafe, while watching Iceland take out England in the Euro Cup.  It was a bit strange to leave my friends at the hotel and go back to my house, but that's OK.  I feel like I'm living in both worlds at the moment.

# Day 2
<h2 id="Jun-28" class="hidden-xs">Tuesday June 28</h2>

I started the day at the new coffee shop on Elbasan rd, called Mulliri Vjeter.  It's a 2-story self service coffee shop with nice chairs and decent wifi.  In the early morning it's pretty quiet up on the 2nd floor, but the cappucino is not as good as my favorite at Mon Cheri.  Pal, Lauren, Danita, Chris and Fatmir joined me after a bit.  We hung out and talked about Albania & Tirana.  At 10:00 we had to head out.  They went to their morning devotional, but I had to go help set up for the conference again.  Fortunately they didn't need me too much so by 10:30 I was able to join the American team.

We talked business for a bit then ended around 11.  We didn't know what to do since the camp wouldn't start until 4.  I tried to message a guy for coffee but he didn't have time today, so we hung out in the basement playing Jungle Pong for a while.  The girls started working on their "Relationships & Sex" talk which they will give later this week.  Matt is doing the guys' side of the sex talk.  He was planning to do more prep later, but for now Jungle Pong takes precedence.  In my opinion, his priorities are absolutely in the right place.

We went for lunch at a Greek place down in the "Block" (Blloku).  It had all kinds of different cuisines.  Some of the guys got shwarmas.  I was craving something kinda american, so I got the "American Pastrami".  It was not that great, but it tasted American.  We talked about some of the difficulties that the RPJ staff have had this year.  Several of the students have fallen away, caused problems, or generaly not been involved.  They asked us to try to spend some good quality time having coffee with believers, hoping to get them to dive deeper into their faith.  I think this is a good goal.

We played some more jungle pong after lunch, and around 5 started the camp.  We played a game called "Soularium", in which we spread a bunch of pictures out on the floor.  The students were asked to select pictures that represent how they feel their life looks right now.  One of the girls, for example, picked the one with a scale because she feels uncomfortable about her weight.  Then Aldo asked them to pick two pictures that describe God.  Most of the students picked ones with a light, or beautiful scenery.  It gave us an idea where to start with coffee conversations.

We headed out from there to a park with a Basketball and Volleyball court.  My team narrowly lost the championship match in volleyball!  Dang.  It was fun to bond with some of the students over sports.  Will was bonding with a couple others from our group over Basketball.  I tried to entice some kids to throw a frisbee with me but no luck.  Only Dustyn joined me.  He's a cool guy, 2 years ago he was a stinter first in Ethiopia then in Italy.  He's enjoying being part of a CRU ministry again.  Plus he's enjoying speaking Italian with many of the CRU staff here.

We headed back to the office for a debrief, then Berti and Adelina Berhami took us o dinner at Era.  We always have a great time at dinner on these trips and tonight was no exception.  Matt told a few more Laffy Taffy jokes, while at the other end of the table Will was having a good discussion with Berti & Adelina.  Matt also drank 2 more red bulls.  I'll have to ask his roommate Dustyn in the morning whether there was any sleeping in that room.

# Day 3
<h2 id="Jun-29" class="hidden-xs">Wednesday June 29</h2>

Today was a bit tough, and kinda highlighted my dual role here.  In the morning I was unable to join the team for the devotional.  Instead I had a planning meeting with the rest of the Young Professionals staff, regarding next week's YP seminar.  We had a lot to plan and do.  I'm fortunate to have such a well organized leader in Genti Tupa.  He planned everything out very well, I only asked him to allow me and Lauren time for our Albanian lessons.  I have to make sure to build that time into the schedule or my lesson times won't be consistent enough for me to learn.

I grabbed a Byrek më Gjizë (a delicious cheese-filled pastry which I've come to love) on the way back to the office.  After scarfing down that deliciousness I went for coffee with a believer named Emmanuel.  He's a good kid, he's just not been coming to RPJ much recently.  Turns out he was dating a girl who didn't want him to go.  Now that they've broken up he's coming back.  He's interested in programming, so I showed him some of the parts of my blog where I discuss programming challenges.  Incidentally it had an error so I showed him how I kill the server and automatically restart it.  I also showed him my blog post detailing the reasons I decided to come to Albania.  This led to a discussion about heavenly rewards and investing in the Kingdom of God.  He seems to think everyone will be equal in heaven so why bother?  As long as his entry is secured he doesn't care to invest more.  We talked about how there will be no jealousy or pride in heaven, but when we do good works here then God allows us to enjoy their fruit for eternity.  Ron also talked to him a bit about dating, and gave him good advice for future relationships.

In the afternoon we had a Master Chef competition.  The kids each got about $5 to buy fruit and then turn it into some artwork.  The kids did a great job!  We have a bunch of artists.  We finished the meeting off with dancing.  After the meeting we went out to do some street evangelism.  I paired up with Igli, a volunteer who was a high schooler 2 years ago at Ice and Spice.  He helped translate for me while I engaged a couple high schoolers.  The first pair was completely apathetic.  The guy said he wasn't afraid to die, he knows that we just end and there's nothing after death.  I asked, "How do you know?  What reasons do you have to believe that?"  He said he has none, but his mind tells him that's the truth.  He didn't care to know more.  The second pair we talked to were muslims.  Very active in the mosque.  We started talking about Jesus and they said that we are wrong to say Jesus was God.  They are not interested in talking about historical evidence, they are completely convinced by the Qur'an.  They quickly left the conversation.

We regrouped at the Pyramid, and while waiting for the rest of the group a few of us climbed to the top.  That was the first time I had been up there, it's a lot of fun to climb it!  We were planning to go to Aldo's house directly from there, Blerina was cooking dinner for us.  Unfortunately Emily & Megi were running late.  I told the rest of the team to go ahead, and I took a taxi with Emily.  It was my first time giving directions in Albanian, and my phone was about to die so I was a bit worried!  But we made it no problems.

Blerina made an awesome spread!  Pilaf, Byrek, Fërgesë, macaroni, chicken and potatoes.  Everyone loves fërgesë now.  For entertainment, Amanda danced the nae-nae for us.  She is really good!  But it's really not surprising she's learned it, it seems to be RPJ's favorite song.  We called it a night about 10:30 since everyone was super tired.
