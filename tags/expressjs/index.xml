&lt;p>How hard could it be right? Well, not really that hard at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was tired of having a static site served by apache. I want to do some cool stuff with the google APIs, like maybe a form submit where the results end up in a google doc for me. To do that I need more than hugo&amp;rsquo;s static site generation. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get rid of hugo because I like a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s features, so I added nodejs on top of it as the application server.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
