My friend gave me an interesting challenge recently.  He wants me to show how, given Jesus Christ rose from the dead, therefore the Bible is true.  I haven't really formalized that logic in my own head before, this is my attempt to do so.  It's an interesting challenge because it highlights how the whole authority of Scripture comes down to Jesus' resurrection.

## The ground rules:
* I am given that Jesus Christ rose from the dead, I don't have to prove it.
* I am allowed to assume that the 4 Gospels are eyewitness accounts of the life of Jesus.
* I am not allowed to assume the authority of other scriptures, since that authority is what I'm trying to prove.
* I should stick to deductive arguments as much as possible.

So - here we go!

### Premise 1.A: Jesus Christ claimed he would rise from the dead.
* “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’" (Matthew 27:63)
* And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. (Mark 8:31)
* He said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.” (Mark 9:31)
* “We are going up to Jerusalem,” he said, “and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.” (Mark 10:33-34)

### Premise 1.B: Jesus Christ rose from the dead.
* Given

### Conclusion 1: Jesus Christ had the power he claimed to have, and therefore was not insane.

<hr/>

### Premise 2.A: Jesus Christ had unimpeachable character
* 'But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."'' (Luke 23:40-41)
* The Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5), especially verse 48: "Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."  He tells people to be sinless.  Certainly his enemies would love to prove him a hypocrite.
* He asks his enemies, "Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?" (John 8:46)
* Mark 3:20-29, Jesus is accused of being possessed by a demon.  “How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand." v. 23-24
* “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone." (Mark 10:18) - A note on this.  He is not saying that he is not good, he's saying that he is God.
* Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.  For a note on why that's important, Mark 10:30-32
* Jesus was tried before a Roman court and found innocent, but he was executed anyways because of the mob.  This is in all 4 Gospels.

### Conclusion 2: Jesus Christ was not a liar.

<hr/>

### Premise 3.A: Jesus Christ claimed to be God.
* “I am.” (Mark 14:60-62) (incidentally this is the best verse to show Muslims, who claim that Jesus was not God.)
* “Yes, it is as you say.” (Matt. 26: 63-65)
* “You are right in saying I am.” (Luke 22:67-70)
* “I tell you the truth,” Jesus announced, “before Abraham was, I AM!” (John 8:58)
* “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” (Mark 2:7)
* "But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” (Mark 2:10)
* "So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28)

### Premise 3.B: Jesus was not a liar, nor a lunatic 
* CS lewis' Liar Lunatic Lord argument, which I'm sure you're familiar with.

### Conclusion 3: Jesus Christ was God.

<hr/>

### Premise 4.A: Jesus Christ was God.

### Premise 4.B: Jesus Christ quoted the Old Testament as Truth.
*  ‘Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.’ (Matthew 5:17-18)
* 'Jesus answered and said to them, “Are you not therefore mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?' (Mark 12:24)
* [He made references to more than 40 different OT scriptures](http://www.redletterchristians.org/when-jesus-quoted-the-ot-and-why-it-matters/)

### Conclusion 4: The Scriptures are true.
* At this point you could make the claim Jesus Christ only meant the Old Testament scriptures.  So I'll go a little further.

<hr/>

### Premise 5.A: Jesus Christ delegated his authority over Scripture to the Apostles.
* ‘But the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.’ (John 14:26)

### Premise 5.B: The Apostles included various of Paul's letters in their definition of the Scriptures.
* All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
* [Paul] writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. (2 Peter 3:16) - Note, here Peter affirms that Paul's letters are Scripture.

### Premise 5.C: Apostolic Authority was the most important criteria in deciding what would make up the New Testament.
* The fact is, [which books are included in the New Testament evolved over the first 300 years of Church History](http://www.churchhistory101.com/docs/New-Testament-Canon.pdf).
* Heresies like Gnosticism came up, and uninspired books like the Gospel of Thomas, so the churches began to see a need to have a criterion for inspired works.
* Tertullian, an early church father, [stressed Apostolic Authority in writing against the heresy of Marcion](http://www.letusreason.org/Biblexp174.htm).
* The only New Testament book without apostolic authority is Hebrews, only because we don't know who wrote it.

### Conclusion 5: The New Testament is true.

<hr/>

## Recap
There it is.  You can see from the above that the truth of the scriptures rests entirely on the authority of Jesus Christ.  The Resurrection is key because it proves His authority.  All of the rest of scripture rests on this historical fact.

## Possible objections:
* The Gospel accounts have been fabricated. (hits premise 1.A & 2.A)
	Please look into the ways each of the 12 apostles died.  If the Gospels were fabricated, why would they die for something they knew was a lie?
* The Gospel accounts have been changed over the centuries.  (hits premise 1.A & 2.A)
	In fact they have not.  We have a ridiculous amount of manuscript evidence allowing us to reconstruct with incredible accuracy the original documents.
* Jesus could have played an elaborate hoax, while still being God or some alien with supernatural power. (hits premise 2.A)
	First let's be clear, this objection asserts that a god-like being assumed human form, performed miracles, lived a morally perfect life, allowed himself to die extremely painfully, and rose 3 days later as some elaborate hoax.  There is no shred of evidence to support this.  Furthermore, in this case you could not trust any physical evidence of that period (it could all be part of this god-like being's hoax!).  This seems to me akin to saying "we can't know for sure we don't live in the Matrix".
* The Gospel writers were eyewitnesses, but their testimony is unreliable. (hits premise 1.A & 2.A)
	I'd ask you to read "The Case for Christ" by Lee Strobel.  He makes a strong case that the eyewitness testimony is reliable.
