My friend gave me an interesting challenge recently.  He wants me to show how, given Jesus Christ rose from the dead, therefore the Bible is true.  I haven't really formalized that logic in my own head before, this is my attempt to do so.  It's an interesting challenge because it highlights how the whole authority of Scripture comes down to Jesus' resurrection.

## The ground rules:
* I am given that Jesus Christ rose from the dead, I don't have to prove it.
* I am allowed to assume that the 4 Gospels are eyewitness accounts of the life of Jesus.  I can use them to show things that Jesus said or did, but cannot take their interpretations of these events as authoritative.
* I am not allowed to assume the authority of other scriptures, since that authority is what I'm trying to prove.

So - here we go!


### Premise 1.A: Jesus Christ predicted he would rise from the dead, in accordance with the Scriptures.
* “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’" (Matthew 27:63)
* And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. (Mark 8:31)
* He said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.” (Mark 9:31)
* “We are going up to Jerusalem,” he said, “and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.” (Mark 10:33-34)

### Premise 1.B: Jesus Christ rose from the dead.
* Given

### Conclusion 1: Jesus Christ had supernatural power and authority over death.

<hr/>

### Premise 2.A: Jesus Christ claimed the authority of God over the Law & the Prophets (i.e. the Scriptures).
* “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” (Mark 2:7)
* "But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” (Mark 2:10)
* "So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28) (Lk. 6:5)
* "You have heard that it was said… But I say to You…" (Matthew 5, repeated)
* "He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes" (Matt. 7:28)
*  “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth” (Matthew 28:18)
* <span style="font-weight:bold">Jesus Christ also claimed to be God, which includes his claim to authority over the Scriptures.</span>
* “I am.” (Mark 14:60-62) (incidentally this is the best verse to show Muslims, who claim that Jesus was not God.)
* “Yes, it is as you say.” (Matt. 26: 63-65)
* “You are right in saying I am.” (Luke 22:67-70)
* “I tell you the truth,” Jesus announced, “before Abraham was, I AM!” (John 8:58)

### Premise 2.B: Jesus Christ had supernatural power and authority over other areas (i.e. death).

### Conclusion 2: Jesus Christ had the authority of God over the Scriptures.

<hr/>

### Premise 3.A: Jesus Christ had the authority of God over the Scriptures.

### Premise 3.B: Jesus Christ affirmed the Old Testament as Truth.
*  ‘Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.’ (Matthew 5:17-18)
* 'Jesus answered and said to them, “Are you not therefore mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?' (Mark 12:24)
* [He made references to more than 40 different OT scriptures](http://www.redletterchristians.org/when-jesus-quoted-the-ot-and-why-it-matters/)

### Conclusion 3: The Scriptures are true.
* At this point you could make the claim Jesus Christ only meant the Old Testament scriptures.  So I'll go a little further.

<hr/>

### Premise 4.A: Jesus Christ delegated his authority over Scripture to the Apostles (via the Holy Spirit).
* ‘But the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.’ (John 14:26)
* “I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. 13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come." (John 16:12-13)

### Premise 4.B: The Apostles included various of Paul's letters in their definition of the Scriptures.
* All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
* [Paul] writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. (2 Peter 3:16) - Note, here Peter affirms that Paul's letters are Scripture.

### Premise 4.C: Apostolic Authority was the most important criteria in deciding what would make up the New Testament.
* The fact is, [which books are included in the New Testament evolved over the first 300 years of Church History](http://www.churchhistory101.com/docs/New-Testament-Canon.pdf).
* Heresies like Gnosticism came up, and uninspired books like the Gospel of Thomas, so the churches began to see a need to have a criterion for inspired works.
* Tertullian, an early church father, [stressed Apostolic Authority in writing against the heresy of Marcion](http://www.letusreason.org/Biblexp174.htm).
* The only New Testament book without apostolic authority is Hebrews, only because we don't know who wrote it.  But it agrees in every major point with the rest of the New Testament.

### Conclusion 4: The New Testament is true.

## Recap
You can see from the above that the truth of the scriptures rests on the authority of Jesus Christ.  The Resurrection is key because it proves His authority.  The key is in the context, and in the character of Jesus.  As Christians, we take the truth of Scripture on the authority & character of one who rose from the dead.  I can think of no better way to learn about Spiritual things than from someone who has been there and returned.

Even the Apostle Paul recognized this fact:

> And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead.
