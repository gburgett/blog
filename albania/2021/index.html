A pastor came all the way across Tirana, even during curfew, just to talk to him. That made a huge impression on him.</li></ul></li><li>Luka said that last year he didn&rsquo;t want to be a believer because he thought that meant he couldn&rsquo;t have fun anymore. I shared that I am a &ldquo;Christian Hedonist&rdquo; like John Piper</li><li>Encouraging to get to invest in some young believers.</li></ul></li><li>Andrew went for coffee with a young boy named Alessio. He accepted christ tonight! Andrew had been working with him all week</li><li>Met up for dinner with Berti and Adelina Berhami at Stephen Center.

Sara said that this is what we&rsquo;ve been needing, since she experienced this many years ago in Dallas. Berti was studying at DTS at the time and the family were members of Watermark. Sara and Klea both went to WM youth ministry.</li></ul></li><li>After dinner we took a nice walk through town and arrived safely at our hotel, and of course went directly to sleep.</li></ul><h1 id=day-7>Day 7</h1><h2 id=Sep-25 class=hidden-xs>Saturday Sept 25</h2><ul><li>Met with Genti Tupa early<ul><li>Had to change things up with the YP ministry, almost &ldquo;starting from zero&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s looking to connect with the medical community now as he has a supporter who will come who is a doctor.</li><li>Talked about asking around our church if any lawyers would be interested in coming to Albania to make inroads with the legal community there.</li></ul></li><li>Covid test time! Went to a testing site on the other side of the city<ul><li>Anxiety that one or more tests would be positive. Us all being negative would be a miracle.</li><li>Allye said it best, &ldquo;praying that God would help my attitude if we&rsquo;re not all negative&rdquo;.</li></ul></li><li>Coffee time with Klei and Albi<ul><li>Klei is a typical high school student, he didn&rsquo;t say much in response to questions.</li><li>Just wants a family and a good job. We talked about having a bigger purpose for your life. He says he is a believer but hasn&rsquo;t been very much involved in church. Albi is trying to get him to go to church in Yzberisht together with albi</li></ul></li><li>Meeting time at 11am<ul><li>There was a funny skit about a couple who goes to the movie theater. They have to sit on opposite sides of the row, and a jerk of a guy is in between them. The boyfriend passes gifts along to his girlfriend but they all end up being eaten or somehow messed up by the jerk. Meanwhile the other guy actually sitting next to the girl presents the gifts as though they are from him, and the girlfriend ends up leaving with the other guy!</li><li>Brian did an excellent job with the Gospel presentation!<ul><li>Very clear explanation of the 4 laws</li><li>Left the final slide up for the duration of the meeting - &ldquo;you must make a personal choice&rdquo;. Sam said he appreciated that this slide remained up for the whole meeting</li></ul></li><li>Lots of dancing! Our last chance to get in all the albanian dancing we want</li></ul></li><li>Lunch afterwards with about a dozen students.<ul><li>Allye talked to Nertila for a while, she&rsquo;s a believer</li><li>I tried to engage Igli and his brother Bruno in conversation. I asked them what they want out of life - &ldquo;money&rdquo;. We talked about John D Rockefeller, who when asked how much more would satisfy him, said &ldquo;only 1 more dollar&rdquo;. I was trying to make the point that Igli will never be satisfied, but he seemed to like that phrase. Or at least it was &ldquo;cool&rdquo; to like that in front of his friends. I challenged him instead to seek Wisdom, and we read some from Proverbs about how wisdom is more valuable than gold and silver. Pray for him, he didn&rsquo;t seem interested in taking that path.</li></ul></li><li>Headed back to the office and piled into 3 cars to go out to Durres for the evening. This was our time of rest, relaxation with our Albanian friends, and evaluation of the project.</li><li>First, we toured the Roman amphitheater in Durres. It&rsquo;s likely the 2nd largest ever built by Rome outside the Coliseum.<ul><li>It&rsquo;s thought that Titus was martyred here</li></ul></li><li>Drove down to the beach and a nice outdoor seafood restaurant there. We walked the beach a bit and took some photos before heading in to eat.</li><li>Discussed the project, what went well, what we could do better.<ul><li>The video was a hit, we&rsquo;ll definitely have to make a better one next time. Maybe Jordan Thompson would be on board?</li><li>Doing a run-through of texas night and our gospel presentation would have helped.</li><li>Praise the Lord for negative covid tests! We all got the emails at dinner. It&rsquo;s seriously a miracle that none of us caught it.</li><li>It was good to see both new students and returning students. It&rsquo;s important to invest in the believers too.</li></ul></li><li>After a long and enjoyable dinner, we said goodnight to Kaon and Danjela as they were returning separately with their kids. The rest of us packed up in the cars again and went to the hotel.</li><li>Since our flight out was at 4am, we decided to leave the hotel at 1 to go to the airport. Pal and Genti graciously stayed up to take us there. We chilled at the hotel until 11, hanging out and checking the score of the College Football games. I was watching A&amp;M v Arkansas, while Brian was trying to follow Baylor vs Iowa State</li><li>That last night of time with our friends was hard but good. Good because we are just such good friends now. Hard because of the exhaustion, and wanting to be present to spend time with them. I already miss them.</li></ul><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1></div><div class="col-md-3 hidden-xs"><nav class="bs-docs-sidebar affix"><ul id=h-sidebar class="nav nav-stacked fixed"></ul></nav></div></div></div><footer class=footer style=height:20px><a rel=me href=https://ruby.social/@gburgett></a></footer><link rel=stylesheet href=/js/highlight/styles/vs2015.css><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/main.min.js></script><script src=/js/custom.js></script><script src=/js/highlight/highlight.pack.js></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()</script><script src=//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=/js/albania.js></script></body></html>
