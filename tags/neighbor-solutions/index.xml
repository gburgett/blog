Nowhere has this been more true than with AI. With the rush to stick the AI brand on every project, software engineers
are being pressured to &amp;ldquo;just throw more AI&amp;rdquo; at the problem and hope it works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my hourly contracting on &lt;a href="https://neighbor.solutions/">Neighbor Solutions&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to build a data import
pipeline for community resources. To give a bit of context, one core function of the Neighbor Solutions app is to
help users who have a heart for our unhoused neighbors to guide them towards helpful resources in their community. These
can be food banks, shelters, warming stations, and many more. The major technical difficulty here is getting accurate
data into the system in an automated way. Many times, lists of these resources are in poorly formatted PDFs or screenshots
of webpages. There is very little consistency here, so some amount of natural language processing is required.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
