What is love? Is it just not hurting me, as the song goes?

&lt;p>The scripture has a different definition of love.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. &lt;span class="red">You are My friends if you do what I command you.&lt;/span> No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you. This I command you, that you love one another.&lt;br>
