Uh oh!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="certificate expired" src="http://www.gordonburgett.net/images/2017/cert_expired.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately I just need to request a new certificate from Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt and install it. I&amp;rsquo;ve done this before, it&amp;rsquo;s a 10 minute job. Buuuuuttt&amp;hellip;
what if I could automate it? If I spend all afternoon on this I&amp;rsquo;ll save myself 15 minutes of work every 3 months! That math totally works out right?&lt;br>
What does the XKCD guy have to say about it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taking Control of My Data</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/09_taking_control_of_my_data/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2016 15:33:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/09_taking_control_of_my_data/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my projects during my vacation has been to take back control of my data. The question of online privacy is a difficult one, because while there&amp;rsquo;s some things you can do to improve your privacy, to really own your data takes a lot of effort and learning. For most people, hosting their own services is more headache than it&amp;rsquo;s worth. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good privacy-conscious services out there if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to pay, but most people are not willing to pay. The convenience trumps the privacy concerns, and for me it has been that way for a long time as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adventures in Dockerland</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/02_adventures-in-dockerland/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 20:33:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/02_adventures-in-dockerland/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a serious docker/aws kick recently. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned just enough that it drives me to play with it. I spent a lot of my free time on it this week, and didn&amp;rsquo;t spend as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like on learning Albanian&amp;hellip; This could be a problem&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways I might as well post more about what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make my web server more robust, to where if it dies for whatever reason I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything, it&amp;rsquo;ll come back on a new instance all on its own. Unfortunately that&amp;rsquo;s a bit more difficult than you&amp;rsquo;d expect. Lots of moving parts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docker Cloud is Neat</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/02_docker-cloud-is-neat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2016 14:09:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/02_docker-cloud-is-neat/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had some time off today so I decided to revisit how I&amp;rsquo;m hosting all my stuff. One of my issues with using Amazon&amp;rsquo;s container service is that they make you assign resource values to each container, and those are not flexible. So, I have to give each container high enough memory that it won&amp;rsquo;t die, but then I run out of space on my server real quick. Since most of the stuff I want to host just sits idle the majority of the time, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hosting Reclaimed</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/01_hosting_reclaimed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 21:31:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2016/01_hosting_reclaimed/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s another technical post for y&amp;rsquo;all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had some time this past weekend, so I took a look into the website I made a year ago for &lt;a href="http://www.reclaimed431.org">Reclaimed&lt;/a>. The old version was made with &lt;a href="http://locomotivecms.com/">Locomotive CMS&lt;/a>, and hosted on &lt;a href="http://www.locomotivehosting.com">Locomotive hosting&lt;/a>. It was a good choice at the time, because we needed something fast. We wanted to deploy it before the 2015 super bowl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d previously looked into moving it to Wordpress or Drupal, but that would basically require redoing the whole site. More work than I&amp;rsquo;m willing to put in. But, just this past weekend, &lt;a href="http://locomotive.works/">Locomotive v3&lt;/a> came out. I decided to try hosting it myself, because $20/mo is just a bit too much to be paying for a simple website like this. Plus, it would be fun! (or so I thought.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running with Docker</title><link>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2015/10_running_with_docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2015 20:33:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://www.gordonburgett.net/post/2015/10_running_with_docker/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="locked-out">Locked out!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I managed to lock myself out of my EC2 instance when I was managing my keys. So in order to update my blog, I had to deploy it to a new EC2 instance. I decided to take the opportunity to improve the way I&amp;rsquo;m deploying new versions of my site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: This will be a technical post. If you&amp;rsquo;re following along with my adventure in Albania, you can skip this one.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
