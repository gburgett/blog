      <description>What is love? Is it just not hurting me, as the song goes?
  The scripture has a different definition of love.
 &amp;ldquo;This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. You are My friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.</description>
