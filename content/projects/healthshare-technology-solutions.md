I built the HealthShare app to solve my own problems with Christian Healthcare Ministries (CHM).  We've now grown it into a B2B 
SAAS serving multiple churches.  With the HealthShare app, we've solved the administrative burden of CHM for members,
and we're providing visibility into CHM spend for healthcare plan administrators at our partner churches and businesses.
