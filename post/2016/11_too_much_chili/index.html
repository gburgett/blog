          <h1>When you eat chili 3 days in a row</h1>
          <span class="post-date">Mon, Nov 21, 2016</span>
          <p>We&rsquo;ve been working on follow up since Momentum Europe.  We&rsquo;ve had some good
meetings with people, and had some good conversations.  Of course our goal is
to help our partners to do that more and more - to have the conversations that
lead to Gospel presentations, to encourage them to share with and invite
more people, and to build their confidence.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/yps_byb_1.jpg" alt="professionals on the beach in Durres" /></p>

<p>To that end we organized a training conference this past weekend.  We invited
about 20 young professionals out to Durres for 2 days of working through the
<a href="http://burstingyourbubble.org/">&ldquo;Bursting Your Bubble&rdquo;</a> curriculum.  It was
a great success!  They enjoyed the time together and came away with a stronger
desire to serve and share with their peers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t go.  Saturday morning I woke up vomiting.  I couldn&rsquo;t
eat or drink anything until Sunday.  My roommates Pal and Eriol ended up taking
me to the hospital, where I got an IV and a few prescription pills.  By mid-day
Sunday I felt much better, but by then it was too late to join the group in Durres.
It was probably the chili that I made on Wednesday, and ate for dinner also
Thursday and Friday.  But my roommates also ate it and didn&rsquo;t get sick, so I&rsquo;m
not really sure what it was.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/yps_byb_2.jpg" alt="professionals studying the curriculum" /></p>

<p>It really sucked to not be able to go there.  I was really excited to join them
for the training and see how God was working.  I wanted to share with them some
things I had been learning too, and to encourage them during this time.  This is
probably one of the most important things we&rsquo;ll do all year.  I was really
disappointed that I couldn&rsquo;t go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/yps_byb_3.jpg" alt="The guys really getting into the training" /></p>

<p>At the same time, I think God knew that it would be better for my sake to stay
home.  As I look back, the theme of this past year could be summed up as &ldquo;boasting
in my weakness.&rdquo;  God doesn&rsquo;t need me to inspire the young professionals.  In fact,
anything I can do is only temporary.  God is the one who has to give them a vision
for how He wants to impact Albania.  If I want to see God change young professionals
here, the best thing I can do is pray.  So I did - I spent Saturday evening
praying for them by name.</p>

<p>God is in control - even to the point of making me sick if He needs to.  He&rsquo;s
the one who&rsquo;s going to change the hearts of believers and non-believers here.
Please join me in boasting in the weakness of our staff, and seeing God move
in spite of us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so
that Christ’s power may rest on me. 10 That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight
in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For
when I am weak, then I am strong.
