Hey Y'all!  It's been a while!  I've been busy with settling in to my new job and routine with Watermark.
It's a really great place to work and I feel super blessed to have the opportunity to join staff there!
But even as I readjust to life in America I'm still looking back to Albania and my next opportunity to
go.

And the Lord graciously provides!  I will be going on a trip in December with Will Noll, Matt Rial,
Chris Hyland, and hopefully 1 to 2 others.  We have been communicating with the elders of Guri i Themelit
church over there to set up a weekend guys' retreat, where we will discuss openness and authenticity.
They expect upwards of 50 guys to come out to this retreat!

Please be praying for our preparations and spiritual battles as we get ready to go.  Please also pray for
the hearts of the believers that we'll be engaging with, as we call them to die to themselves in a culture
that does not value authenticity.  This is something that's at the same time needed, wanted, and
unfortunately difficult to achieve.  It's also an area that the Lord has blessed Watermark with a lot of
great materials and the example of having put it into practice.

I'm of course planning to take as much vacation as possible in order to stay several days past the end
of the retreat.  I'm really looking forward to having as much coffee as possible at Mon Cheri with all
my friends! I'd also love to hit up my old Qeliza (community group) and see how things have been going.

We'll need to raise $1500 total to cover the expenses of the retreat, on top of our plane tickets.  We
are putting the plane tickets on our own credit cards and are fully committed to doing this, regardless
of how much we end up raising.  At the same time, we do want to offer y'all the opportunity to join
us through financial support.  So as soon as we get the details squared away I'll send an email out
to [my email list](http://localhost:8080/albania/#newsletterSignup).

Looking forward to sharing more details with you all in the coming weeks!
