This month, while we've been working on the summer project here in Albania, I've
been reading the book of Acts.  I love all the descriptions in the book of Acts
of faithful people who were not Apostles.  Some of them, like Cornelius the centurion,
had been faithful for a very long time, and God answered their prayers powefully.

> About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in
> and say to him, “Cornelius.” And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it,
> Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial
> before God.
> ...
> While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the
> word. And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed,
> because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.

Our past or at Watermark, Todd Wagner, recently did a sermon series on the book of
Acts.  His main point was that the book of Acts didn't end, the story continues through
us as the Church.  Acts is just the beginning of the Church Age.  The Holy Spirit is
just as much at work today as He was back then, and in areas of the world where believers
are less blind to His effect, He is working just as powerfully as back then.

> “Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do;
> and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.

In this blog post I want to collect some of the stories that have happened during
the month I've been staying in Albania.  For those who didn't know, after the summer
project finished ([which you can read about here](/albania/2018)), I have been
staying in Albania and working remote.  The number one reason is that my good friend
Pal Hila is getting married on the 28th.  But I also want to be available for
additional follow up and discipleship from the project.

## Stories worth sharing

### Pastor On Call Opportunities

Even though I'm on the IT team at Watermark, I still get opportunities to be a Pastor
On Call, or respond when others need help.  For example, one of my POC opportunities
was meeting a homeless couple together with Bruce Kendrick, Ben Pukas and Jessica Coates.
I got the husband's phone number and have been keeping up with him ever since, trying
to help them get plugged in at Watermark and into ReGen.

On my first day working remote from Albania, I had another opportunity when a friend
called and wanted to have a coffee.  I ended up taking an extra hour in the middle
of the day, which I made up later that evening, to talk with him.  He was feeling
really down and upset at himself, partly due to circumstances and partly due to his
own procrastination.  After talking a while we also discussed some sin issues that
were in his life, and I got to encourage him with what I've been learning through
ReGen.  He doesn't feel like his life can change.  I used to feel that way too.
But our God is in the business of changing lives.  I'm continuing to pray for him
every day I'm in Albania.
