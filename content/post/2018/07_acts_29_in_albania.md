This month, while we've been working on the summer project here in Albania, I've
been reading the book of Acts.  I love all the descriptions in the book of Acts
of faithful people who were not Apostles.  Some of them, like Cornelius the centurion,
had been faithful for a very long time, and God answered their prayers powefully.

> About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in
> and say to him, “Cornelius.” And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it,
> Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial
> before God.
> ...
> While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the
> word. And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed,
> because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.

Our past or at Watermark, Todd Wagner, recently did a sermon series on the book of
Acts.  His main point was that the book of Acts didn't end, the story continues through
us as the Church.  Acts is just the beginning of the Church Age.  The Holy Spirit is
just as much at work today as He was back then, and in areas of the world where believers
are less blind to His effect, He is working just as powerfully as back then.

> and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.

In this blog post I want to collect some of the stories that have happened during
the month I've been staying in Albania.  For those who didn't know, after the summer
project finished ([which you can read about here](/albania/2018)), I have been
staying in Albania and working remote.  The number one reason is that my good friend
Pal Hila is getting married on the 28th.  But I also want to be available for
additional follow up and discipleship from the project.

## Stories worth sharing

### Pastor On Call Opportunities

Even though I'm on the IT team at Watermark, I still get opportunities to be a Pastor
On Call, or respond when others need help.  For example, one of my POC opportunities
was meeting a homeless couple together with Bruce Kendrick, Ben Pukas and Jessica Coates.
I got the husband's phone number and have been keeping up with him ever since, trying
to help them get plugged in at Watermark and into ReGen.

On my first day working remote from Albania, I had another opportunity when a friend
called and wanted to have a coffee.  I ended up taking an extra hour in the middle
of the day, which I made up later that evening, to talk with him.  He was feeling
really down and upset at himself, partly due to circumstances and partly due to his
own procrastination.  After talking a while we also discussed some sin issues that
were in his life, and I got to encourage him with what I've been learning through
ReGen.  He doesn't feel like his life can change.  I used to feel that way too.
But our God is in the business of changing lives.  I'm continuing to pray for him
every day I'm in Albania.

I also got to encourage a couple friends who are going through some conflict, some
of it as a result of the demands of this project with Sotmeria.  They had come to
me to discuss some of the difficulties, failures, and miscommunication that occurred.
I told them about the 24 hour rule that Watermark staff has.  If I were to come to
you and tell you about issues I have with another person on staff, even say Todd
Wagner himself, you would respond by asking me to go directly to Todd and share
these concerns.  You would tell me that in 24 hours you'll call Todd yourself and
say that Gordon had something to talk to him about, and ask if we had had an opportunity
to meet.  If not, you'd offer to go together with me to clarify things.

I explained to my friend that I think the same rule applies here.  I'd been praying
for them throughout the week, and later heard that they were able to have a great
conversation with the people that they had been compaining about.

### Evangelism Opportunities

While working remote in Tirana, I decided not to simply work from the apartment
where I was staying.  I paid for 2 weeks in a co-working space, which turned out to
be a great decision not just for my own sanity, but also for opportunities for
evangelism.

The first opportunity I had was with a guy whom I'd shared the Gospel with over a year
ago.  He was in town just for one day, but I was able to meet with him because I was
already in the center of the city.  He doesn't consider himself a Muslim or a Christian.
He's in the process of finishing reading the Koran, and I encouraged him to read the
Bible as well.  I helped him to download the Bible app on his phone, and showed him
how to activate the audio-book feature.  I will keep up with him over facebook to
encourage him to keep reading the Bible.

My second week in the office I struck up a conversation with the IT manager for the
office.  We were able to go out for coffee the next day, and had a nice long conversation
where the Gospel was clearly shared.  He comes from a Muslim background but does not
practice.  In fact he considers religion to be too wrapped up in politics.  He looks
at ornate churches and mosques, and wonders why they don't do more for the poor. He's
also had a very bad experience with corruption here in Albania, and is mostly looking
for a way out.  He told me he'll be "reborn" when he manages to leave Albania.

We talked about the Gospel message, as I was explaining why I had come to Albania
(this is apparently a hot topic - why would an American like me want to come to Albania?).
We discussed 1 Corinthians 15, as I was making the point that my faith is rooted in
fact.  He was surprised that I actually believe in an afterlife.  He does not.  He's
very much got his hope rooted in this life only.  Please pray for Edison.

> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.
> Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have 
> hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.
> <span class="source"><a href="http://biblehub.com/esv/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:17-19</a></span>

Another opportunity came at the same office, on my final day.  As we walked in to the
office, the manager asked me how it can be that a engineer, a scientific type, can
be involved in the church?  Don't I see them as incompatible?  She and I had a wide ranging
discussion in full view of the entire office.  One of the ladies with her door open
said that she was interested in the conversation but had work to do, so she was listening.

I shared some of my personal testimony about how God used the book "The Case for Christ"
by Lee Strobel to bring me to Himself.  As I read that book, I realized that Jesus
Christ's resurrection is a historical fact.  And it occurred to me for the first time
that I had not been living as though that fact were true.  It's the fact that changes
the entire direction of your life.  This is how a scientist or engineer can believe
the Bible, because it's rooted in fact.

I again went back to 1 Corinthians 15 to point out that even Paul the Apostle, whom
I consider an authority on the subject, said that without the resurrection our faith
is worthless.  She said that she cannot believe in something that is outside the
natural order of things.  I replied with a smile that it appears that I have the
more open mind.  Please pray for Eriona.
