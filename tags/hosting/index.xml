      <description>Locked out! I managed to lock myself out of my EC2 instance when I was managing my keys. So in order to update my blog, I had to deploy it to a new EC2 instance. I decided to take the opportunity to improve the way I&amp;rsquo;m deploying new versions of my site.
Note: This will be a technical post. If you&amp;rsquo;re following along with my adventure in Albania, you can skip this one.</description>

      <description>So I wanted an app server. How hard could it be right? Well, not really that hard at all.
I was tired of having a static site served by apache. I want to do some cool stuff with the google APIs, like maybe a form submit where the results end up in a google doc for me. To do that I need more than hugo&amp;rsquo;s static site generation. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get rid of hugo because I like a lot of it&amp;rsquo;s features, so I added nodejs on top of it as the application server.</description>

      <description>I decided to use Amazon EC2 to host the blog, because they give you 1 year free on a micro instance. Plus I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to learn how to host something on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s cloud. I&amp;rsquo;ll get a linux instance and put an Apache HTTP server on it. Should be easy enough to do.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my EC2 management console after signing up for an Amazon account and creating a linux micro instance: !</description>

      <description>Well, here it is. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to create a blog for a while. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it will look like in the future, or how often I&amp;rsquo;ll update it, but as I sit here writing it it&amp;rsquo;s kind of cathartic. It would be good to get some thoughts out there, and if anybody reads it that&amp;rsquo;s a bonus.
I want to talk about anything and everything on this blog.</description>
