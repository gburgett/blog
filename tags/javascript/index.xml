      <description>I spent some time this week playing with Typescript 2.8&amp;rsquo;s new features for modeling various complex types. The new syntax that I wanted to play with was the conditional type syntax,
T extends U ? X : Y This syntax allows you to express some really crazy type relationships! Some of the most interesting ones have been pre-defined in the Typescript standard lib:
 Exclude&amp;lt;T, U&amp;gt; – Exclude from T those types that are assignable to U.</description>

As always there&amp;rsquo;s good old fashioned Wordpress, and of course there&amp;rsquo;s drag-n-drop website builders like Wix. One thing these have in common is that they need a traditional hosting environment, and for that you gotta pay.
If you can manage it, the cheapest way to host a website nowadays is to create a static HTML site.</description>
